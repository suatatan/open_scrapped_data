Despite this lack of research, support for new firm entrepreneurs has been largely withdrawn in England and Wales with the focus of support, through Personal Business Advisers (PBAs), targeted at existing small firm entrepreneurs who employ more than 20 people and have the potential for growth. There are theoretical arguments that suggest support for new start entrepreneurs should be provided on a mentoring basis. If this is provided selectively, then this should have an impact on the management ability and confidence of such new firm starts. This paper reports the results of interviews with new firm entrepreneurs engaged in such a mentoring relationship. The research, undertaken in Scotland, suggests that such a relationship is beneficial. Given the high failure rates of new firm formation, such support could have wider application and benefits. It is suggested that, for certain regions, provision of new firm support can yield positive and worthwhile returns to public sector investment, particularly in a region such as the West of Scotland, characterised by a need to diversify its economy and raise the formation rate of new start small firms and entrepreneurs.","Start‐ups, Small firms, Mentoring, Entrepreneurs, Networking, Scotland","MCB UP Ltd","Published: 1998, Start page: 102"

This question has confronted many officers engaged in the “enterprise industry”, as they grapple with the task of supporting the increasingly significant phenomenon of ethnic minority entrepreneurship. The situation is complicated by the markedly different experiences of ethnic minority groups in business; the apparently low take‐up of existing services; and wider debates in the policy world encouraging the “integration” of business support activities. Policy initiatives to support ethnic minority businesses have had to engage with such issues; but rarely have they been documented. This paper assesses the experience in a Midlands city of AsCo, a Pakistani‐dominated business group that is attempting to “bridge the gap” between South Asians in the retail sector and the providers of business services. The paper is distinctive in a number of respects: The issue of practical enterprise support provision for South Asian firms has rarely been subject to academic scrutiny. Hence, the paper provides a rare case study of this process in action; The design of the initiative was a genuinely collaborative endeavour involving the researchers, policy makers (the local Training and Enterprise Council) and small businesses in AsCo. Indeed, the research was commissioned by the local Training and Enterprise Council (TEC) and AsCo; A methodologically heterogeneous approach is adopted. This involved in‐depth qualitative interviews with 25 member businesses of AsCo (out of a total membership of 80); ten interviews with non‐members; observations of a number of AsCo executive committee meetings; interviews with key TEC officers; and an insider’s view (the second author) of how the research has actually informed TEC policy.","Ethnic groups, Entrepreneurialism, Business development, Case studies","MCB UP Ltd","Published: 1999, Start page: 7"

Quality systems are seen as a necessary qualification for trading in certain markets. This can encourage businesses to think of quality only in terms of the cheapest way to obtain a certificate, thereby failing to appreciate the organisational benefits which could be obtained if more resources were applied to the development of effective quality systems. The use of quality consultants is widespread as a means of implementing ISO 9000. The selection and use of consultants can have a major influence on the commercial impact of quality systems developed through their work. Clients do not always appreciate differences between consultants, who all promise registration. As a consequence, a client often places its trust in the cheapest consultant, the first one to come along, or a friend. This paper, which is based on a survey of SMEs registered to ISO 9000, and will be presented at the Small Business and Enterprise Development Conference, 22nd and 23rd March, 1999, explores clients’ perceptions of value through the development of a model of client‐consultant relationships. It is argued that both clients and consultants need to have awareness of these perceptions at different project stages in order to realise the benefits of consultancy relationships. Clients’ perceptions of value are identified in both the experience of the consultancy relationships as well as the outputs. By viewing client‐consultant relationship development as a process, key activities within a project can be investigated, such as initial contracting and ultimate project outputs. The paper concludes that ISO 9000 can act as a bureaucratic constraint on improvement activities, but can also provide an opportunity to develop structures and processes that help to achieve improvements in a controlled manner. It is argued that the achievement of third‐party registration is largely irrelevant to the effectiveness of a quality system in bringing about improvements, although the prospect of registration is often a necessary driver towards instigating a system. It is shown that quality consultancy relationships are perceived by clients as having widely differing outcomes. These can be both favourable and unfavourable, whilst still meeting the objective of registration.","Perception, Value, Quality, ISO 9000, Consultants, Clients","MCB UP Ltd","Published: 1999, Start page: 7"

It tests the statement that informal institutions can have an impact on people’s decisions, directly and indirectly, by affecting their perceptions of the external world.Design/methodology/approachThe paper develops a theoretical model of the probability of starting a business by a potential entrepreneur. The model takes into account a comparison of current wages and future profits. The empirical analysis is based on European social survey data at the individual level. Three-stage least squares regression helps to overcome the endogeneity problem since perceptions of government actions are individual specific.FindingsInformal institutions can affect expectations about future activities in a person’s lifetime utility maximisation problem. The paper empirically concludes that these institutions are connected with a person’s satisfaction with government and can indirectly affect the probability to be self-employed.Research limitations/implicationsResearch limitations are related to employing proxies for informal institutions, using only the “satisfaction with government” as a perceptions indicator, and cross-sectional data while defining the causal effect.Practical implicationsPolicymakers should consider that institutional settings affect people in a different manner when developing their policies.Originality/valueThe paper makes a novel contribution by analysing the effect of informal institutions on the probability to start a business by using both theoretical arguments and empirical tests.

The findings suggest that franchising is a viable growth strategy for small firms and that per se it creates few major problems for growth‐oriented small businesses. It is argued that further research is needed, particularly into the experiences of “failed” franchises and into the problems encountered by growing small firms who do not adopt franchising as a growth strategy.","Small‐ to medium‐sized enterprises, Objectives, Operations planning, Strategic planning, Capital budgeting, Short‐termism, Ownership","MCB UP Ltd","Published: 1999, Start page: 310"

A series of research propositions are developed which go beyond the formalised, prescriptive frameworks of e‐business as presented in marketing and e‐commerce textbooks.

It is argued that small businesses motivated by a desire to grow in terms of sales and/or employees and to survive in a dynamic and competitive environment need to be innovative. However, to what extent they will innovate successfully depends on their capacity to plan ahead, their capacity to innovate and their willingness to take risk. It is shown that entrepreneurial businesses are characterised by these competencies that allow them to innovate and thus develop and grow successfully. Not surprisingly, not all small businesses are equipped with these three competencies owing to their diverse array of strengths and weaknesses arising from the diversity in the managerial motives and aspirations of entrepreneurship. These results highlight the importance of the capacity to innovate and the capacity to plan ahead as strong predictors of small businesses’ performance.","Entrepreneurialism, Innovation, Planning, Small firms","MCB UP Ltd","Published: 2000, Start page: 7"

Such assistance to small firms was seen to overcome many of the constraints of doing business in a peripheral location such as Northern Ireland. However, one question remains unanswered by that research and that is the precise way in which LEDU financial assistance impacts upon business performance. One interpretation of the research to date could be that the relatively better performance of LEDU‐assisted small firms is due to the fact that they are more likely to be faster growing businesses in the first instance, because either they are self‐selecting in presenting themselves for LEDU assistance or else the LEDU engages in a “creaming” process, which results in the granting of assistance to the more successful firms in Northern Ireland. In order to probe further into the impact of LEDU assistance, it is necessary to examine the differential impact on growth of the wide range of support programmes and initiatives for small firms operated by the small business agency in Northern Ireland. This paper will report the results of the first stage of such an analysis by analysing the business performance of two broad groups of LEDU‐assisted clients who have received different levels of assistance in the 1990s – “Growth” and “Established” clients. The analysis is based on information drawn from a specially created database of approximately 1,600 small firms who were in receipt of LEDU financial assistance in the period 1991‐97. The analysis of the employment and turnover performance of LEDU‐assisted firms revealed that Growth clients grew faster than Established clients in the 1991‐97 period and provides tentative evidence that a more intense and directed package of assistance is clearly associated with faster business growth. The age of Growth firms was much older than Established LEDU clients and, therefore, this differential growth performance cannot be related to a simple life‐cycle explanation. The shift in LEDU policy in the 1990s towards a greater concentration of effort on firms with growth potential would appear to have been successful.","Northern Ireland, Small firms, Policy, Growth","MCB UP Ltd","Published: 2000, Start page: 7"

The Backing Winners (BW) programme differs from previous schemes in that it is not restricted to clients who are unemployed, it provides access to some key business services (such as office services), and there is no grant offered to individual businesses. Delivery of BW is focused on Personal Business Mentors (PBMs) whose role is similar to that of the PBA in Business Links. Based on a survey of 144 clients businesses and interviews with representatives of each of the Enterprise Agencies (EAs) contracted to deliver BW, the conclusion is that it was successful during the first year of its operation. Clients were very satisfied with their PBMs and some were active users of group training and office services. The paper also considers a number of policy issues raised by the study. These include broad issues such as the extent to which there is a case for targeting support on new and young firms such as these, and the extent to which the operation of a selective approach at the start‐up stage involves “picking winners”. In addition, BW raises a number of delivery issues which include: the need for adequate resourcing to enable the workload of PBMs (or PBAs) to be compatible with effective delivery; the need to reconsider the use of freelance consultants as PBMs (or PBAs); the need to recognise that many small manufacturing firms have sector‐specific support requirements; the need to set performance targets to agencies contracted to deliver such programmes, which recognise differences between agencies and their catchments.","Start‐ups, Growth, Business development, Mentors","MCB UP Ltd","Published: 1998, Start page: 199"

Phenomena such as the breaking up of huge companies or dismantling into small and medium‐size enterprises and the increasing number of newly founded small‐size businesses sooner or later lead to changes in the policies of these enterprises and thus contribute to the development of a functioning market economy. The map of the Hungarian economy had changed significantly by the end of the 1990s. A radical shift in the size and types of companies was brought about by market economy forces, which led to a transformation. As a result, the process of accession to the EU was begun. In the preliminary and preparatory stages, the opportunities for small and medium‐size enterprises (SMEs) must be enhanced, as presently the economic significance of SMEs in Hungary is smaller than their strategic importance.

This analysis is undertaken to explore general characteristics, use of external resources and growth orientation.
Design/methodology/approach – Data from the 2008 UK Federation of Small Businesses survey provided 8,000 responses. Quantitative analysis identified significantly different characteristics of firms from 0‐4, 4‐9, 9‐19 and 20+ years. Factor analysis was utilised to identify the advice sets, finance and public procurement customers of greatest interest, with ANOVA used to statistically compare firms in the identified age groups with different growth aspirations.
Findings – The findings reveal key differences between new, young and older firms in terms of characteristics including business sector, owner/manager age, education/business experience, legal status, intellectual property and trading performance. New and young firms were more able to access beneficial resources in terms of finance and advice from several sources. New and young firms were also able to more easily access government and external finance, as well as government advice, but less able to access public procurement.
Research limitations/implications – New and young firms are utilising external networks to access several resources for development purposes, and this differs for older firms. This suggests that a more explicit age‐differentiated focus is required for government policies aimed at supporting firm growth.

It is argued that despite a considerable amount of evidence that emphasises the distinct human resource problems that small firms face because of their size, there is no reason to assume a priori that a formalised HRM approach cannot provide solutions to these — provided that it is sufficiently flexible. The article cautions against accepting the ‘informal’ approach to managing people often associated with small firms as an inevitable or unconditional ‘good’, demonstrating the complexities of small firm employment relations through case studies of four small firms that have adopted the Investors In People initiative. This initiative is shown to embody key principles of HRM thinking and to have provided viable answers to the human resource problems faced by the case companies. The article concludes with a discussion of the issues that will need to be faced if the management of human resources in small firms is to be opened up to new and innovative ideas in a manner that is genuinely constructive and beneficial.","General review","David Goss, Derek Adam‐Smith, Alan Gilbert,  (1994)  ""SMALL FIRMS AND HRM: EXCEPTIONS THAT PROVE THE RULE?"", Journal of Small Business and Enterprise Development, Vol. 1 Issue: 2, pp.2-8, https://doi.org/10.1108/eb020934","Published: 1994, Start page: 2"

This has resulted in an academic argument concerning how best to meet the needs of particular groups of firms in order to reduce the ineffective provision of information and other support activities by these organisations, and the negative perceptions of these bodies from firms within the ethnic communities. In placing this argument into an international context, this study provides empirical evidence concerning the perceived usefulness of sources of export information together with types of data required by groups of Asian and indigenous (white)‐owned small and medium‐sized enterprises (SMEs) in the UK. Findings are primarily based on a large scale sample of UK firms and MANOVA is employed to establish that statistical differences exist between the groups of SMEs.

We have used a 67‐industrial SMEs sample located in the Castilla‐La Mancha Autonomous Community. The information acquired about those firms refers to the years 1994, 1995 and 1996. We have divided this sample into two groups: one formed by newly created firms and another by those companies that have been able to survive their first years of life and develop an activity that we could consider to be established. In order to make the division, we considered new enterprises as those established within the previous five years (created between 1991 and 1994) and established enterprises as those created five or more years previously (created before 1991). The first group consists of 19 enterprises and the second 48 enterprises. A study of those variables that better reflect the potential of the business was carried out. The level of risk, the growth and the profitability, characteristics that we consider very important in order to determine the future viability of any activity were analysed.

Design/ methodology/approach – The paper reports results from field tests of the Virtual Product Development Workshop (VPDW) approach to introducing leaders of small businesses to the benefits and practical issues involved in adding e‐commerce capabilities to their firms.
Findings – The paper finds that the benefits to smaller business of e‐commerce are real. Even so, senior staff in smaller firms have been reluctant to invest the time and resources needed to develop e‐commerce activities tailored to their firms' strengths and needs. A training approach blending online preparation and physical participation is found to be more effective than either approach alone. This paper allows senior staff participation in tailored e‐commerce design with a lower time and monetary commitment than other sources of individualized support.
Research limitations/implications – While the participants in the field tests represented small business from throughout Europe, there was little participation from outside Europe.
Practical implications – The approach described provides a route to exposing senior staff in small businesses to opportunities and solutions for e‐commerce implementation. The VPDW approach allows customized advice at a lower cost and using less time than other sources providing firm specific advice.
Originality/value – The paper provides guidelines to running a successful VPDW. Recommendations address the kick‐off, introductions, context and content, participants' experience, and the closing.

It argues that there has been a neglect of such work in academe. Yet there has been a growing import into the UK of ideas from abroad (mainly from the US). There has also been an extensive export particularly to Transition economies. The results in both respects have been less than satisfactory. There is also greater opportunity for ideas transfer via the new communication technologies. The European Commission is particularly active in the field of transfer. There is therefore a strong case for greater academic interest. The paper explores the concept of transfer by posing four questions: (1) What does the notion of transfer mean? (2) Where are the academic challenges in such processes? (3) Where might there be opportunities for transfer in the future of relevance to UK SME development? (4)How and where might we begin to address the issue? In addressing question one, six key areas are identified: ideology transfer; concept/paradigm transfer; benchmarking; institutional development; programme transfer; and transfer of process insights. The second question looks at the academic challenge through the lens of a number of problems, including those of ideology, culture, language, concept, context, agency, reasoning and rationality, agenda, field of production, and customer. Each of these areas is defined, and examples are given of the kinds of problems that arise and their impact. The third question is addressed by a short and speculative review of possibilities for transfer of ideas to the UK relating to the broad areas of policy, institution development and assistance to SME development. The final question is approached by a brief review of the potential for action by journal editors, academic groups and policy makers.","Idea generation, Knowledge transfer, Small‐ to medium‐sized enterprises","MCB UP Ltd","Published: 2000, Start page: 199"

Multiple business entrepreneurs were defined as SME owner‐managers who are both serial and portfolio owners simultaneously. Among successful owner‐managed SMEs 22 per cent of firms were owned by such multiple entrepreneurs, and only 50 per cent by single business entrepreneurs. The comparison revealed 11 variables that showed differences between these two groups of SMEs. Multiple entrepreneurship was emphasized among entrepreneurs of growth firms.

Khan, Associate Professor at the Lahore University of Management Sciences, for his contribution during the statistical analysis phase of this research.","Purpose – A major frustration for most policy researchers in the small to medium‐sized enterprise (SME) area is the virtual non‐existence of scientific data on this sector in the country. This paper aims to provide some data.
Design/methodology/approach – A survey of 651 SMEs from the manufacturing sector of Pakistan was conducted in 2003 and statistical analysis was carried out to analyze the data. This paper focuses on the relationship between the health indicators namely, sales/employee, increase/decrease in sales, and investment plans and the different personal characteristics of the owner/entrepreneur.
Findings – This analysis suggests that education, generation setting up the business, and number of partners have a significant relationship with the health of SMEs. Health of the firm is also dependent on owner habits like watching television, reading newspapers and using computers for office work. Other factors like caste of the owner and occupation of the owner's relatives were also analyzed, but no significant relationship with the health of an SME was observed.
Practical implications – The implications of this study are far reaching in understanding the profiles of owners of SMEs in Pakistan and how these profiles impact the profitability of the firms.
Originality/value – To date no other such study has been carried out in Pakistan. Similar studies on owner profiles have previously been carried out in other countries such as the UK and USA.","Research paper","Published: 2008, Start page: 8"

A two‐stage methodology was used, with three companies being studied in‐depth and three as supplementary cases. The top‐down strategic planning mode, which dominates the manufacturing strategy literature, was found to be inadequate as a depiction of manufacturing strategy formation in SMEs in practice. Manufacturing strategy formation was shown to be a complex process involving a combination of deliberate and emergent actions and decisions, influenced by organisational culture, politics and powerful individuals. Emergent actions and decisions within manufacturing always played a part in manufacturing strategy formation. Manufacturing strategy formation could be more deliberate if greater use was made of business planning and by the identification of a set of explicit objectives for manufacturing. Manufacturing strategy formation could be less emergent if political behaviour could be reduced. Other factors that seemed to be influential included the interpretative processes of managers, the role of a corporate parent and the level of management education.","Manufacturing strategy, Small‐ to medium‐sized enterprises, United Kingdom, Research","MCB UP Ltd","Published: 2002, Start page: 100"

The primary focus of the research is to understand the messages and compare social media adopters with non-adopters. The paper addresses wider questions of the use of social media to support on farm entrepreneurship and business and considers what barriers to take up exist within the industry.Design/methodology/approachThe paper adopts a case study approach utilising qualitative and quantitative methodology; combining survey data on Welsh farms and semi-structured interviews to gain a deeper understanding of social media use. The research is further informed by online documentary evidence gathered from agricultural Facebook pages and Twitter accounts. The discussion section develops a conceptual model that provides a novel perspective on social media usage in agriculture-based enterprises and discusses the potential for further uptake.FindingsThe paper identifies barriers to adoption of social media by agriculture-based enterprises. In conclusion, although there are barriers and objections to social media use, its mass influence provides opportunities to engage with stakeholders and develop more entrepreneurial activity. The risk aversion of some users prevents them from moving from the observational mode into one of engagement.Originality/valueThis paper brings an insight into social media’s potential to assist agriculture-based enterprises in dealing with the tensions between pressures to improve core farming practice and other entrepreneurial activity.

However there is limited evidence of the contribution of training to the success of individual firms and even less evidence of the impact of such training activity on small to medium‐sized enterprise (SME) employees. This paper draws on a survey of 1,000 employees to investigate the impact of a training intervention on employees in SME workplaces. It explores issues associated with the equity of provision of training in the workplace and the impact of training on the employability of SME employees in the labour market. The results suggest that training interventions lead to positive outcomes for the majority of SME employees, particularly those working in organisations with relatively formalised training practices. It concludes by suggesting that there should be a greater focus on the employee dimension in research and policy regarding training in SMEs.","Research paper","Published: 2004, Start page: 427"

Samuel Baixauli  (Department of Management and Finance, University of Murcia, Espinardo, Spain)","The authors thank Fundacion Cajamurcia and the Spanish Government (Project ECO 2008‐02846) for financial support.","Purpose – This paper aims to construct a financial health indicator to define the degree of financial health in order to decontaminate the estimation sample and to make predictions that are not biased by unhealthy firms.
Design/methodology/approach – The binomial logit model is used to examine the likelihood that a firm will go bankrupt. In order to evaluate the accuracy of the estimated models, measures proposed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision are applied: cumulative accuracy profile (CAP) and the receiver operating characteristics (ROC).
Findings – The proposed financial health indicator permits the heterogeneity of the firms to be reduced as well as identifying a strong firm sample to estimate the bankruptcy probability accurately.
Originality/value – A drawback of all bankruptcy prediction models comes from the fact that bankruptcy is an example of a homogeneous observable qualitative response while non‐bankruptcy would be expected to be represented by a healthy firm. However, the non‐bankruptcy firms are heterogeneous and their actual probabilities of bankruptcy are non‐observable. The article adds to the previous literature on SMEs' bankruptcy prediction by using a financial health indicator to construct the estimation sample and to make accurate bankruptcy predictions.","Research paper","Published: 2010, Start page: 8"

The results of the survey indicated a generally high level of satisfaction with the support provided by PSYBT and with the aftercare counsellor. There were, however, expressions of dissatisfaction from some respondents and a number of potential areas for improvement were identified. These primarily related to the skills, knowledge and attitude (ie “competence”) of the aftercare counsellor which could be addressed through enhanced recruitment, induction, supervision and continuing training and development processes.

Design/methodology/approach – Based on Miles and Snow's adaptive cycle, this study examines the coherence of HRM practices with the strategic capabilities of manufacturing SMEs (n=176) in terms of products, markets, and networks. A principal component factor analysis was first made to reduce the HRM practices into a lesser number of factors. A clustering algorithm was then used to determine three groups of SMEs or Gestalts. Finally, an a posteriori examination of the performance of each group was made.
Findings – SMEs align their HRM practices with their realized strategy within three configurations, namely local, international, and world‐class SMEs. Regardless of their strategic choices, these SMEs achieve comparable levels of performance.
Research limitations/implications – The Gestalts perspective seems effective in its capacity to describe the role of the HRM function. While the firms surveyed are fairly representative of Canadian manufacturing SMEs, there might yet exist a bias in that these are firms that have chosen to undertake a benchmarking exercise.
Originality/value – The study is one of the first to use Miles and Snow's adaptive cycle as a foundation to specify the type of activities that researchers should consider in assessing the SME's overall degree of strategic alignment. A practical implication for owner‐managers is that their strategic choices in terms of product innovation, market expansion or network extension must be inter‐linked with the development of their HRM practices.","Research paper","Published: 2009, Start page: 7"

Findings – This study shows the importance of entrepreneurs for the rapid internationalization of firms in Australia and Sweden. Different types of entrepreneurs were identified and small but important differences were identified between the two countries and different industries.
Research limitations/implications – This study shows that analysis on an individual level enhances the understanding of internationalisation in new firms. By using the concept marketing and technical entrepreneur in different industrial contexts a more detailed understanding of different internationalization patterns can be obtained. This study is limited to two countries and six case studies. The findings may be limited to the chosen firms and studies across more countries and industries are needed.

The paper seeks to examine the relationship between businesses' perceptions of the economy and their growth ambitions.
Design/methodology/approach – The results were generated from a bi‐monthly online survey of SMEs. The survey includes two years of data from July 2010 to May 2012, spanning periods of recovery and recession. The survey comprises a number of Likert‐scale questions which have been tracked throughout the period.
Findings – The findings suggest a separation of how businesses perceive wider economic conditions, and their role and performance within the economy. Views on trading conditions and public sector cuts are identified as a more important determinant of business behaviour than views on the economy overall.
Research limitations/implications – The findings are based on research undertaken with SMEs in a specific geographical area of England and, as such, there is limited scope for generalisation beyond this area. Further research could compare the responses of SMEs in this predominantly rural area with metropolitan areas, for example.
Practical implications – The paper highlights the importance of revenue sourced from the public sector for SMEs in peripheral areas. Policy implications include the need to support SMEs in identifying alternative sources of revenue and/or new business models in the face of reducing public sector expenditure.
Originality/value – The paper presents an innovative approach for analysing SME perceptions, the findings of which have informed a business support programme run by the University of Lincoln, and used as a benchmarking tool by participating SMEs.","Research paper","Published: 2013, Start page: 453"

As part of the case study, participant observation was carried out and interviews with the novice entrepreneur, the firm’s employees and its customers were conducted.FindingsDeveloping mutually beneficial relationships with customers and key partners can enable a novice entrepreneur with no prior business ownership and limited marketing experience to accumulate and mobilise resources in order to achieve credibility and business growth.

The possibilities of co‐operation between high‐technology SMEs as a mechanism for enhancing individual firm growth is considered. The current stock of empirical evidence on high‐technology SMEs is outlined and the fact that few small firms achieve substantial growth highlighted. The major barriers to growth which lie behind this outcome are considered. The possibilities of networking, in its various forms, are considered as a facilitating medium for aiding business growth, with particular attention paid to high intensity co‐operative arrangements. The need for heterogeneous skill possession is emphasized, and how environments comprising homogeneous core competencies make networking an inappropriate solution for business growth. The existing empirical data on SME networking is considered and the relative costs and benefits of membership tabulated on the basis of network type. This leads on to an analysis of how beneficial, long‐term arrangements between actors may not occur in the market because of short‐term risks associated with other party(ies) defecting, as can be modelled within a prisoner's dilemma game theory structure.

Three learning outcomes are examined with respect to a comparison between habitual and novice entrepreneurs: skills for coping with liabilities of newness, preference for effectual reasoning, and attitudes towards failure.
Design/methodology/approach – This is an empirical study based on statistical analysis conducted on a sample of 231 Swedish entrepreneurs that have started a new independent firm in 2004.
Findings – The findings suggest that habitual and novice entrepreneurs differ significantly with regard to several interesting aspects of the hypothesized dimensions.
Research limitations/implications – The findings provide a better understanding of start‐up experience as a source of learning and its effects on the skills, preferences and attitudes of habitual entrepreneurs.
Originality/value – Previous research has suggested that prior start‐up experience is an important source of entrepreneurial learning, but has not put much effort into explaining how this particular type of experience influences various learning outcomes on an individual level. The present study advances these suggestions by showing how prior start‐up experience influences entrepreneurs' skills for coping with liabilities of newness, effectual reasoning and attitudes towards failures.

The model was developed to explain the apparent mismatch between the need for marketing activities to sustain and grow these companies in a competitive business environment (i.e. relevance of marketing) and the actual marketing efforts used by these organisations (i.e. role played by marketing). The methodology used theoretical development and initial testing of the role and relevance model on a small number of SMEs. Primary data were collected via interviews, questionnaires and observations of the marketing activities of the organisations studied. This paper describes the role and relevance model in theory and shows how to apply the model in practice. The results of the initial tests using a carefully selected number of SMEs are discussed and form the basis of the illustrative case studies presented in this paper.","Research paper","Published: 2002, Start page: 331"

Until recently, research on the founding of new ventures has focused mainly on the personal characteristics of entrepreneurs, but this trait approach tends to underestimate the role of crucial skills. The findings of this paper suggest that it is not so much inherent personality traits that influence the foundation and growth of new ventures as previous employment and entrepreneurial experience. The longer the career path prior to founding the venture, the more experience an entrepreneur has accumulated. Age thus seems to have a positive influence on the success of a newly founded venture. Furthermore, the dimensions of human capital, experience and previous employment seem to be essential in building the networks that help secure both early and continuing finance for the ventures.","Research paper","Published: 2003, Start page: 372"

The objective is to propose new analytical elements to improve the formulation and execution of the integration process between an SME (small and medium enterprise) and a large enterprise.
Design/methodology/approach – The authors develop a theoretical framework based on the main research results from several fields, including technology transfer, innovation dissemination, and management. This case study then focuses on a merger in the IT sector in real time.
Findings – This study allowed the authors to test theoretical elements, especially the choice of the integration method, which may favour the creation of technological innovation during the integration period. The authors present new reasons for the failure of co‐created innovation between an SME and a large enterprise in the IT sector. This case study allowed them to test theoretical elements such as the choice of an integration method which could favour the creation of technological innovation during the integration period while enriching scientific knowledge by proposing a dynamic approach to the integration process.
Originality/value – Before managers can envisage symbiosis between two merging firms, they first need to go through a period of exploration, which may entail costly mistakes. Yet this exploration period may be necessary to enable them to discover the limitations of a strictly rational approach to the integration process and to broaden their normal frame of reference. For this in‐depth study, the authors benefited from free access to a substantial amount of information that is generally unavailable for scientific research, which greatly contributed to their work. The authors' theoretical framework is not exhaustive, but they tried to incorporate the most significant research results.","Case study","Published: 2012, Start page: 192"

Discourse analysis was used to develop a multi-layered explanatory model incorporating key ideas from critical realism and the work of Bourdieu.FindingsBourdieusian analysis reveals the existence of orientations among small business owners towards or against business growth. Such attitudes tend to impact upon their response to perceived barriers. Growth-inclined owners were willing to strategise for long-term benefit, in return for lower returns in the short term. Growth-resistant owners were more likely to view obstacles as absolute, stating that they cannot grow their firms as a result.Practical implicationsRemoving or reducing obstacles may not encourage growth if motivations and attitudes of owners do not change to embrace more growth-oriented positions. Banks’ lending practices, for example, were seen by many as problematic, but growth-oriented owners were more willing to seek and use alternatives to raise funds for growth.Originality/valueThe authors suggest that entrepreneurship researchers should look beyond positivist research to epistemologies that provide more multi-layered modes of explanation.","Research paper","Published: 2017, Start page: 670"

Polarity in corporate board research around two primary tasks (control and service/strategy), neither captures comprehensively the range of SME board types, based on what they actually do, nor elucidates how boards configure and why. SME heterogeneity is problematic for understanding how the triumvirate of power and control – owners, directors and executives – governs in such firms.Design/methodology/approachSurvey research is used to examine 186 French private SMEs. Factorial and cluster analyses are used to classify board configurations according to board task performance.FindingsResults reveal six different board types among small firms. The findings indicate that both organisational and board design need to be adjusted to align with the differentiation between the ownership and the management, and between the ownership and the directorship. The greater the differentiation between these power/control functions in response to increased internal and/or external contingencies, the more varied will be the board’s portfolio of tasks, with implications for the director capabilities and board competence.Research limitations/implicationsThe research extends SME board governance theory and practice by bringing greater clarity to the field of board task performance in SMEs. It provides insights into explicit board task-related configurational behaviour through recognising the degree of differentiation between the triumvirate power/control functions at the apex of the small firm. SME boards in the sample show not just a single configuration but a combination from a portfolio of tasks with different emphases on each according to their circumstances. This finding implies that a particular type of board may select a task, or set of tasks, from the portfolio, depending on the nature of the SME in terms of its proximity – whether it is characterised more by specificity or by denaturation. Further research is needed to understand the variation in these configurations over time in response to internal and external contingencies and what board emphases and processes are involved in transitioning through these evolutions.Practical implicationsThe findings are important because the extent of knowledge about what the configuration comprises will determine how effectively a board will execute its tasks. This knowledge is useful in helping boards place emphasis on how best to concentrate their efforts on creating value for the SME, by selecting an effective combination of tasks from a given board configuration depending on their circumstances.Originality/valueThe research extends SME board governance theory and practice by bringing greater clarity to the field of board task performance in SMEs. It provides insights into explicit board task-related configurational behaviour through recognising the degree of differentiation between the triumvirate power/control functions at the apex of the small firm.","Research paper","Published: 2017, Start page: 426"

The authors want to thank all consultants and small firms participating and sharing their time and reflections with them. The usual disclaimers apply.","Purpose – The aim of the article is to explore the dynamics of the management consulting process for small firms as an outcome of interactive processes.
Design/methodology/approach – The explorative study is based on a summary sketch of an interactive research project (LOS) in which small firms and their interactions with management consultants were studied in a three‐year perspective. The theoretical framework employed is based on the industrial network theory.
Findings – The study suggests that clients are co‐producers of the consulting process. Therefore, management consulting in a interactive perspective has important elements of trailing, i.e. changing the frames of reference of the consulting process and creating room for consulting in which the consultant, as well as the client, allow themselves to experiment with their professional foundations. However, it is also suggested that innovative learning processes are difficult to foster in management consulting processes.
Research limitations/implications – The empirical foundation of this explorative study is limited and thus invites to further interactive studies along the paradigm of action research.
Practical implications – Based on the findings, it seems important that both clients and consultants accept the consulting process as a co‐productive process, and that they find a way to work out the expectation gap at the beginning of the process.
Originality/value – The study adopts an industrial network perspective on the consulting process. In this perspective social exchange and adaptation processes among actors, i.e. consultant and client are in focus.","Research paper","Published: 2006, Start page: 299"

From a number of perspectives it may be argued that it is fortunate that the pace of recovery from the longest post‐war recession is faltering and slow. How can slow recovery from the longest recession since the war be welcome when almost 44% of the small businesses responding to the National Westminster Bank / Small Business Research Trust surveys report low turnover or lack of business as the major constraint, with the smallest businesses being affected most? The reason is that the economic and social policy cocktail which offers the prospect of sustained growth has yet to be discovered in the UK, if indeed such policies exist. Over the past thirty years (excluding the oil shock of the early 1970s) two periods of decline in real GDP have occurred, both since 1980 (Budget Statement 1990/1). It thus appears that the downside swings in the economy are becoming more pronounced. Recent reductions in interest rates are helpful in encouraging recovery but policies which smooth rather than accentuate fluctuations in the levels of economic activity are what is really required. These policies need to be established within the context of a strategy for managing the UK economy. Such a strategy must incorporate the role of small firms which, as recent evidence shows, continue to be a very important segment of industry and commerce despite the ravages of recession.","General review","Francis Chittenden,  (1994)  ""SMALL FIRMS AND THE PROSPECT OF RECOVERY: A NOTE ON POLICY"", Journal of Small Business and Enterprise Development, Vol. 1 Issue: 1, pp.54-56, https://doi.org/10.1108/eb020933","Published: 1994, Start page: 3"

This paper considers that these missing pieces of the puzzle could be diverse non‐financial and behavioural factors influencing capital structure decisions, that have received relatively little attention from finance researchers. The paper reports on an exploratory attempt to use interview techniques for the study of capital structure in small firms. Interviews can provide evidence about non‐financial and behavioural variables that quantitative analysis cannot. The paper develops a model for understanding capital structure decision making in small firms. It analyses the responses of small business owners/managers concerning the management of the financial structure of their firms and the factors that influence their capital structure decisions. Small business owners’ responses indicate that although a number of different financial variables may affect their capital structure decisions, other non‐financial and behavioural factors such as the need for control, risk propensity, experience, knowledge and goals may be more important in influencing the capital structure of their firms, at any time. The results indicate that significant progress in understanding the factors that influence capital structure may be achieved if financial researchers incorporate management theory in their studies, so that financial as well as non‐financial and behavioural factors are explored.","Capital budgeting, Financial management, Gearing, Small‐ to medium‐sized enterprises","MCB UP Ltd","Published: 1998, Start page: 199"

The extent to which environmental scanning behaviour helps firms to protect their intellectual assets is investigated, and the effects of national cultural values on environmental scanning behaviour are analysed.
Design/methodology/approach – The hypotheses are tested with survey data from 123 biotechnology SMEs located in 14 countries.
Findings – Environmental scanning appears to be an important step in the intellectual property strategy, as it enhances the firm's capacity to protect its intellectual assets. Nevertheless, the results show that firms located in cultures with high uncertainty avoidance, high power distance and low individualism do more scanning, whereas the capacity to protect intellectual assets is perceived as being more important in firms located in cultures with low uncertainty avoidance, low power distance and high individualism.
Research limitations/implications – Certain limitations should be noted. For instance, the research is based on cross‐sectional data, which provide limited insight into the temporal aspects of dynamic environments.
Practical implications – The study has important implications for practitioners. It demonstrates that, in international working relationships, cultural values have a direct effect on environmental scanning behaviour, and hence an indirect effect on intellectual property (IP) protection capability. Given the strategic importance of scanning and IP for innovative firms, the results could help managers to make strategic decisions, specifically in R&D internationalization through decentralization or partnership.
Originality/value – Although few studies have empirically analysed the role of environmental scanning in a particular domain, such as intellectual property strategic management, or adopted a comparative cross‐cultural design to do so, this paper investigates the role of environmental scanning in intellectual property strategy from a cross‐cultural perspective.","Research paper","Published: 2010, Start page: 167"

Empirical data are drawn from recent surveys of SME managers in the food and clothing industries in Poland, Bulgaria and the Baltic States, which is compared with the results of similar surveys in the UK and Greece. The results show that the ability of SMEs in transition countries to compete in foreign and domestic markets, varies between sectors. In food processing, although some SMEs have been able to penetrate foreign markets, the main effect so far has been to increase the level of competition in domestic markets. The evidence shows that foreign market penetration by food processing SMEs in transition countries is often focused on markets in other transition countries rather than in Western markets. In the clothing industry, the effects of internationalisation are different because of the highly internationalised nature of the clothing market and the production system that supplies it. In this context, SMEs in countries such as Poland and Estonia particularly, have been able to attract subcontract type work from Western countries, based on their relatively low labour costs. However, as the Greek experience demonstrates, this type of production can be very volatile, disappearing almost as quickly as it is secured. Despite detailed differences between countries and between sectors, the evidence shows that in all the Central and East European countires (CEECs) featuring in the study, some SMEs in the emerging private sector are responding to new foreign market opportunities and, in the short term at least, managing to achieve competitiveness. However, there is also evidence that their current basis of competitiveness in foreign markets contains weaknesses which may affect their ability to sustain their export effort in the longer term. As far as SME managers in transition countries are concerned, the main priorities for government action to improve their ability to increase foreign market sales are assistance with export promotion and a reduction in the level of domestic taxation. The survey results show that although a significant minority of exporters in transition countries had been using external assistance to support their export effort, this was typically either on a fully paid for basis from consultants or informally from other firms or business associates rather than from trade organisations or formal business support organisations.","Small‐ to medium‐sized enterprises, International business, Competition, Export, Europe","MCB UP Ltd","Published: 1998, Start page: 297"

While very little research has been targeted specifically at the growth of micro‐enterprises, there are a host of possible influencing factors suggested by the rather broader small business literature. Less research has attempted to integrate the factors that influence growth of small firms into some form of model. Those models that were found had a number of shortfalls when it came to understanding the development of micro‐enterprises. A framework has been developed through this research that addresses these shortfalls. First, it has targeted specifically gradual growth micro‐enterprises; secondly, it is rigorously under‐pinned through empirical research; thirdly, it attempts to comprehensively cover the range of factors that influence development; fourthly, it focuses on the complex interaction of factors that may influence development. The research findings and implications are presented in two parts. Part 1 develops an empirically verified framework that explains how growth is influenced by a myriad of interacting factors. This leads to a discussion of the policy implications of the framework. Part 2 is presented in the next edition of the Journal of Small Business and Enterprise Development (JSBED) and will explore the managerial implications of the framework. This will provide a diagnostic toolkit to help micro‐enterprise owner‐managers and advisers pursue growth. The paper is derived from research conducted initially for the submission of a PhD thesis at the University of Brighton (Perren, 1996).","Start‐ups, Growth, Development, Small firms","MCB UP Ltd","Published: 1999, Start page: 310"

Anecdotal evidence suggests that “new” (post‐1992) universities are more likely to offer consultancy services to small businesses. It is also claimed that owner/managers seem reluctant to pay full economic prices and would only subscribe to HEI‐based consultancy services if and when these are supported by considerable subsidies. In order to test the owner/manager reluctance hypothesis, 60 matched case studies were conducted, involving small businesses based in the West Midlands region of Great Britain. Preliminary results indicate that most small business owner/managers are aware of the potential benefits accruing from ICT and e‐commerce and tend to use HEI‐based consultancy services as a subsidised access point to e‐markets, involving both their core and peripheral activities. There exists, however, an apparent mismatch between the supply and demand sides of the HEI‐based ICT and e‐commerce consultancy market.","Electronic commerce, Consultants, Universities, Small enterprises, United Kingdom","MCB UP Ltd","Published: 2003, Start page: 233"

The research also aimed to improve the quality of management guidance and the long‐term future for these centres. Questions were posed to identify the extent to which centre managers perceived their business strategies to be entrepreneurial and innovative, as they attempted to decrease dependence on public funding by generating additional business income. Emergent strategies, networking, telecommunications and building partnerships with both private and public organisations allowed some centres to expand and to move from total reliance on public funding to a mix of private and public sources of income. Although initial public funding is seen as an important factor in reducing the early vulnerability of business resource centres, the ability of opportunity‐seeking managers to develop an innovative range of services, including a mix of those offered free and those that required fees, was an important factor in survival. Two detailed case studies (private and mixed) are presented as generic prototypes.","Emergent strategy, Policy, Networking, Teleworking, Start‐ups","MCB UP Ltd","Published: 2001, Start page: 5"

Design/methodology/approach – Data were collected in the rural areas of 36 Dutch municipalities by means of a detailed survey. This resulted in 260 response cases. The analysis consists of a descriptive account of respondents' intentions to expand a side activity and a logistic regression explaining growth expectations of these activities.
Findings – The main conclusion is that although growth is not expected in a large number of side activities, there is a group of owners who clearly aspire to expand the scale of their activities. Their personal aspirations and aspirations for economic well‐being are the most common motivations. These characteristics also have a bearing on the future growth of side activities and consequently their impact on rural development.
Research limitations/implications – Since this article examines growth expectations and not actual growth, the findings cannot be interpreted directly in terms of economic impact on rural development.
Originality/value – Scholars and policy makers have paid little attention to side activities in rural areas and specifically to their growth potential. This article enhances our understanding of the growth expectations of those who carry out side activities and shows the potential of such activities in diversifying and revitalizing rural areas.","Research paper","Published: 2013, Start page: 453"

First, firms in the Irish furniture industry predominantly adopt “simple” business development strategies. Secondly, in terms of profit performance, we find no evidence that simple strategies unambiguously outperform more complex approaches. Instead, the success of both simple and complex business strategies is directly related to the strength of firms’ resource base. Finally, systematic differences were found in firms’ ability or willingness to re‐engineer their strategies in the light of their profit performance.","Small firms, Business strategy, Business development, BPR, Furniture industry","MCB UP Ltd","Published: 2001, Start page: 205"

According to the “agency model”, this change in status provides the financial incentives necessary to ensure that company performance will improve post‐MBO. The key financial incentive present is that the rewards of better performance now accrue to the management team rather than to the previous owners. The “agency model” argues that having a significant financial stake in a company will militate against discretionary behaviour by the new owners. A sample of small management buy‐outs was analysed in terms of two performance indicators, cash management and profitability. Performance was measured against three benchmarks: prior company performance, the performance of companies of similar size and the performance of the industry average. In general, there is no real evidence of better cash management but there is some evidence of improved profitability. The results therefore, offer limited support for the role of incentives proposed by the agency model.","Buyouts, Performance indicators, Performance measurement, Modelling","MCB UP Ltd","Published: 1998, Start page: 199"

Addressing environmental awareness, not to mention sustainability, is a complex issue for SMEs, exacerbated by a lack of time, resources and environmental expertise. Consequently, many initiatives have been developed to direct and support SMEs. This paper is concerned with an initial evaluation of one such initiative based on a grounded theory approach. This process highlights the practical issues SMEs face when trying to implement environmental issues as workable company policies. A “gap” between developers and users in terms of the achievable outcomes perceived and obtained from such initiatives is also highlighted. To date, little has been written about the problems SMEs face in addressing environmental issues. This paper attempts to highlight some of these problems and, more importantly, promote further debate and discussion.","Small‐ to medium‐sized SMEs, Environmental management strategy, Grounded theory","MCB UP Ltd","Published: 2000, Start page: 295"

Design/methodology/approach – An explorative case study is used to explore whether effectuation theory is a fruitful alternative perspective compared with the dominant paradigm (causation), which is primarily used in earlier studies on born globals.
Findings – The study shows how a born global company could enter many markets in a short time, by co‐operating with local network partners. The founders' prior knowledge and networks were important to understand the rapid international expansion. Effectuation theory focuses on the entrepreneurs' ability to create opportunities together with network partners and is a useful tool to understand the development in the born global firm.
Research limitations/implications – The study shows that effectuation theory holds promise for developing the international entrepreneurship area. Future research is recommended to focus not only on the entrepreneur's competencies, but also on the entrepreneur's behavior, including during the time before they started the firm.
Practical implications – Decision‐makers in the early development of born global firms are recommended to use his/her own and his/her company's resources and network. Also advantage should be taken of opportunities when they are recognized or created, instead of focusing on traditional planning activities.
Originality/value – There are few studies that have used effectuation theory as a basis for understanding the early development of a born global firm.","Research paper","Published: 2011, Start page: 430"

Design/methodology/approach – The human capital components considered in this paper are education, previous work experience, employment motivations, the presence of entrepreneurial teams, and the presence of family members in the firm. To attain the objective of the paper we carry out a regression analysis using a rich data set of 635 Romanian firms for the year 2006.
Findings – Consistent with different employment growth measures, the empirical findings indicate that human capital matters for explaining small firms' employment growth. Previous work experience, the presence of entrepreneurial teams and the proportion of family members working in the business appear as determinant components. In addition, the results indicate that an active involvement of the entrepreneur in managerial tasks increases the intensity with which the entrepreneur makes use of his/her human capital, and this leads to higher employment growth rates.
Research limitations/implications – The main limitation of the paper lies in the absence of a longitudinal analysis that could have given a greater perspective to the study. In order to enrich the analysis, future research should attempt to further explore the impact of human capital components on small firms' growth in other transition economies.
Originality/value – The paper increases the literature dealing with the determinants of small firms' growth in transition economies. The results of the paper also have important implications for academics and support institutions in Romania, as they suggest that, in the Romanian context, small firms may obtain significant benefits from support policies more oriented towards the formation of human capital.","Research paper","Published: 2011, Start page: 8"

This scheme enabled many small firms to take advantage of expertise in all areas of business through a grant‐aided programme. The key objectives of the research were to understand better the attitudes held of marketing in the small firm sector in order to identify if there were perceived barriers in accepting marketing techniques to aid a firm’s development. Secondly, the research focused on the specific benefits derived from the Marketing Initiative in an attempt to identify the educational benefits of participating in such schemes. The research findings indicated that there were considerable attitudinal barriers to implementing marketing among the sample firms. They key issues were marketing being perceived as a costly, time consuming to manage, lacking relevant skills to implement marketing and lacking understanding of the relevancy of marketing to development needs. This was in addition to a general misconception of what being “marketing oriented’ actually meant. This general lack of understanding and misconception highlighted the need for such schemes to help in part overcome such perceptions. As for the benefits of the Marketing Initiative, the results were more encouraging, with all respondents perceiving the scheme and its aims as very worthwhile and relevant to their needs. Main benefits derived by participation in the scheme included a greater understanding of marketing and its relevance in the small firm, new market opportunities identified through expert research advice and a detailed plan of action to follow for future development.","Small firms, Marketing concept, Business development","MCB UP Ltd","Published: 1998, Start page: 199"

Following the introduction of the Single European Currency (referred to as the “Euro” throughout this paper), the paper suggests that there will be a major squeeze on price differentials between European Union (EU) member states, creating a danger that existing price‐based positioning strategies will be undermined. This “European pricing and positioning time bomb” will affect UK SMEs (as well as larger businesses) over their short‐term planning horizon, even if UK entry into the Euro is delayed indefinitely. Strategic responses to the Euro will be most effective if they are planned and implemented at the earliest possible time. This paper explores and analyses the findings from a small sample survey of export‐active, consumer goods manufacturing, Northampton SMEs, carried out in late 1997. The aim is to establish their existing pricing and positioning strategies for EU Europe, their preparedness at that time for the introduction of the Euro and the main forms which their pricing and positioning strategies for the Euro were then taking. The findings suggest that most of the SMEs surveyed were in the early stages of planning for the Euro, but that many had not yet fully grasped its strategic marketing significance. Three categories of current marketing postures are identified: price standardisation, price but not product differentiation, and price differentiation supported by product differentiation between EU markets. The paper concludes by evaluating the effectiveness of responses based on these three alternative categories to the new marketing environment in EU Europe that the Euro will create. A set of strategic recommendations is also made for SMEs’ pricing and positioning strategies in the Euro context.","Currency, European Union, Small‐ to medium‐sized enterprises, Export, Manufacturing, Price, Pricing strategy, Product differentiation, Positioning","MCB UP Ltd","Published: 2000, Start page: 105"

Finally, the authors would like to thank all those members of the general public who participated in the study.","In the two decades prior to 2000, the UK franchise industry showed substantial growth. Subsequently, however, this growth appears to have reached a plateau, with growth of less than 1 per cent. Franchisors suggest that the biggest barrier to growth is a lack of suitable franchisees. One possible reason for the dearth of potential franchisees is a lack of public awareness of franchising and the opportunities it affords for both self‐employment and small business development. This paper examines, therefore, public perceptions of franchising in the UK; how well the concept is understood, how it is perceived and the policy implications. The study is based on a sample of 1,257 members of the public surveyed in five city centres in the UK. The results reveal that approximately a fifth of those questioned had no comprehension of the term franchising, while a further third showed limited understanding. Only a tenth demonstrated a clear grasp of the term. The paper concludes that, if franchising is to continue to grow and to achieve its potential for the creation of self‐employment and the growth of small firms, public awareness needs to be raised and the image of the sector improved.","Research paper","Published: 2004, Start page: 8"

The research reported in this paper aims to focus on a study of software‐related companies that form part of an important sector for potential growth.
Design/methodology/approach – This article reports findings from a study of 20 software related small‐ to medium‐sized enterprises (SMEs). The overall purpose of the research was to establish a model whereby companies within the cluster could identify the training and development needs of their employees, and also of their management team(s). Interviews were held with owner managers and senior staff, and a training needs analysis was conducted in each organisation.
Findings – A number of factors were hindering the development of managerial talent in the sample. These included their small size, a lack of resources and availability of personnel for release to undertake development programmes as well as a shortage of specialist human resource management (HRM) expertise.
Originality/value – This research contributes to the growing body of knowledge in the field of strategic human resource development in SMEs. However, the identification, understanding and development of knowledge capital are vital to compete within international markets and the knowledge economy.

Satchell  (Honesty Limited)","The development of the Single European Market and the resulting publicity has persuaded many smaller firms to look to continental Europe as their first choice for market expansion opportunities. These include many UK small firms in the service sector where the economic benefits of a reduction in trade barriers are not so apparent. The approaches used by small service companies and professional practices in dealing with Europe are examined to identify the lessons learnt and to draw comparisons with Central Government advice. Semi‐structured interviews were held with managers from a randomly drawn sample of small firms in the UK with experience of exporting their services to Europe. The firms had experienced varying degrees of success with their forays into Europe. The study suggests that some small service sector firms may have greater potential in non‐EEC and/or English‐speaking nations than in Europe and that for many the experience of Europe has been expensive and erroneous. Small service firms should look to match their strengths to the market, which may be in Eastern Europe, South Africa or the Middle East, rather than tackle an EEC country where their competitive advantages are limited and market conditions may be hostile.","General review","W.K.J.

In this paper, strategic alliances are shown to be an effective entry‐cum‐deterrence strategy for SMEs to successfully penetrate markets that are well established and dominated by major corporations. In addition, the conditions under which SMEs can use strategic alliances as an entry strategy without restricting themselves to target only those markets ignored by bigger firms are identified. In terms of methodology, this paper follows a deductive approach – one based on game theory, to examine explicitly the reactions of bigger firms to the entry of SMEs into their markets, specifically taking into account the resource limitations faced by SMEs. To verify that the theoretical arguments presented are consistent with practice, two cases of the use of strategic alliances by SMEs as an entry strategy to penetrate markets dominated by major corporations are examined. The practices and experiences of these SMEs were found to be consistent with the theoretical arguments presented here.","Alliances, Strategy, Operational research, Small‐ to medium‐sized enterprises, Market entry","MCB UP Ltd","Published: 2000, Start page: 7"

Healey  (Leicester University Management Centre, Leicester, UK)","The ‘barter’ of goods (or services) for goods (or services) between companies, either on a bilateral basis or (more usually) via the intermediation of a broker, has been growing rapidly in recent years. In the United States, barter transactions between US companies amounted to an estimated $9bn in 1995. While historically a US phenomenon, the practice is increasingly spreading to Europe, Asia and Australia. There is now a growing number of so‐called ‘barter exchanges’ operating in Britain and continental Europe. The primary purpose of this paper is to assess the prospects for the development of the British barter exchange industry over the medium to long term. It provides an overview of barter exchanges, examining the US barter exchange industry, which is at a much higher level of development than its British counterpart, in order to identify the way in which the industry operates and the factors which are critical to its growth. It then assesses the prospects for the British barter exchange industry, drawing upon the lessons of the US experience.","General review","Nigel M.

The authors would like to thank the anonymous reviewers for their helpful comments. The authors would also like to thank the delegates at the Small Business and Enterprise Development Conference for their helpful feedback on an early version of this paper. This case study was undertaken as part of one of the authors' doctoral research (Boxer, 2010).","Purpose – Research into top management team (TMT) performance and consensus has been equivocal; furthermore, research into the role of non‐executive directors (NEDs) in UK SMEs concluded that multiple perceptions of “reality” exist between directors. By adopting an innovative methodological approach to analysis, the “black box” complexity of SME board information processes, perceptions and TMT relationships are made visible. This allows the tension caused by differing perceptions of the NED role on a small company TMT to be explored. The aim of this paper is to do this.
Design/methodology/approach – In an in‐depth case study of one SME board, four directors' information and perception differences are investigated using a combined Johari window and set theory framework.
Findings – Application of this innovative analytical framework allowed the information process and differing perceptions of multiple directors to be plotted systematically. This surfaces the normally hidden “generative mechanisms” underlying the “real domains” of the SME board processes by explaining why and how the directors choose to share and hide information about the NEDs' role. Surfacing the nature of this information sharing and hiding is at the heart of appreciating the process of precarious equilibrium that achieves a fragile cohesion within the TMT.
Research limitations/implications – This study reveals the fragility of TMTs to the process of information sharing and hiding. It demonstrates the sensitivity of the group to perceptions of the NED role and the influence the NED can have on information processes within the group and potentially its cohesion. NEDs joining small company boards need to be sensitive to the existing informational asymmetries that may be vital to maintaining precarious equilibrium and cohesion. In their role they are likely to become the confidant of more than one director and thus nodal points of “secret” information. They need considerable interpersonal sensitivity and tact if they are to fulfil their role of challenging the directors without detrimentally disrupting the group dynamic.
Originality/value – This paper answers the call for more qualitative research to investigate the “lived experience” and “behavioural processes” of directors by adopting the combined Johari window and set theory framework. This analysis tool offers an innovative method that will be of value to other researchers and practitioners investigating TMT group dynamics. It provides a rare opportunity to understand the information process and perceptions of a small company TMT and the influence on the equilibrium and cohesion of the group.","Research paper","Published: 2013, Start page: 8"

New technology can seem a threat to small business owner‐managers and there is a link between business growth and the use of IT. There has been increased adoption of all categories of software, from databases, CAD‐CAM and presentation packages, to spreadsheets and communications software, but respondents expressed dissatisfaction with software, more than with hardware. There is a perceived lack of expertise in the planning process as well as the technology itself. Responses were split over loss of managerial control: SME owner‐managers want to remain in control, IT may be associated with growth, and some may resist growth. A strong need for impartial advice, independent from computer vendors, has been expressed, and a worrying number of respondents did not consider maintenance and training costs when purchasing technology. Organisational factors such as staff skill levels, familiarisation time, and the impact on jobs, were rarely considered prior to purchase. Opinions on training provision were divided. More complex IT‐related business and organisational changes may require integrated technical and managerial training, so that SMEs can become more strategically oriented and benefit better from IT.","Small‐ to medium‐sized enterprises, Information technology strategy, Managerial power","MCB UP Ltd","Published: 1998, Start page: 199"

This type of failure may be caused because the key decision makers in such firms are not well informed about the strategic landscape in which their firm operates. A military analogy is used to show that successful military campaigns are often predicated upon having accurate maps. Similarly, competitive strategies followed by firms are likely to be more successful if key decision makers possess accurate strategic maps which display the location of their own and rival firms. In other words, those firms which have detailed knowledge of their strategic landscapes are likely to enjoy significant competitive advantage, while firms which are in ignorance of their strategic landscape are less likely to be able to navigate a route that will confer sustained competitive advantage. A firm’s strategic landscape is analysed in terms of: the firm’s true competitive position, the industry conditions under which the firm and its competitors operate and the core strategies that firms in the industry are following. This paper analyses an approach to strategic mapping developed by a major new independent strategic database called CAM (Competitive Analysis Model). This database has been built to aid small firms improve their results through generating accurate strategic maps. These maps enable client firms to assess their strategic locations and performances longitudinally, sectorally and cross‐sectionally. Finally, CAM clients appear to have outperformed similarly structured non‐CAM firms.","Small firms, Marketing strategy, Strategic planning, Competitive advantage, Databases, Performance, Benchmarking","MCB UP Ltd","Published: 2001, Start page: 5"

Although learning can be said to have a critical role in entrepreneurial achievement, the relationship is not well understood and, given the growing public policy emphasis which aims to stimulate entrepreneurship through formal education, there is a need for a greater understanding of how entrepreneurial capabilities are developed through life and work. The primary research method is through life story interviews with people who have demonstrated entrepreneurial attainment in running business ventures. In‐depth interviews explored their stories of the learning they experienced during their careers and business ventures. From the interpretation and analysis of these narratives, a number of significant themes emerge which suggest how the respondents made sense of their experiences and developed their entrepreneurial capabilities. From these themes, a conceptual model which relates the development of entrepreneurial learning to entrepreneurial achievement is proposed.","Entrepreneurialism, Learning, Narratives, Social sciences","MCB UP Ltd","Published: 2001, Start page: 113"

The major change from the point of view of the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) in setting up Business Links is that there will be a customer‐centred service with a single local response. This has meant that the many different local organizations (e.g. Training and Enterprise Councils, chambers of commerce) have had to form partnerships and often co‐locate services and staff. There has been a singular lack of independent research in this field. The recruitment of a team of PBAs based on the DTI model for PBAs and the published research available on the topic is described.

Design/methodology/approach – The relationships were investigated through an analysis of peer‐reviewed research published in a wide range of journals and proceedings between 1995 and 2006.
Findings – Findings suggest strong evidence supporting the relationship between levels of general education and several entrepreneurial success measures. The findings are less clear in regards to the link between general education and the choice to become an entrepreneur. The findings linking specific programs of entrepreneurship education to entrepreneurship, although ambiguous, suggest a positive link between such education and both the choice to become an entrepreneur and subsequent entrepreneurial success.
Research limitations/implications – The review of research suggests four implications for existing research: a need for increased research outside the USA; an understanding that inconsistencies in findings may be to a great extent temporal artifacts; a need for increased research focused on innovation; and an acknowledgement that “venture exit” as an outcome measure has received limited attention.
Practical implications – Given the significant investments by both private organizations and governments aimed at increasing rates of entrepreneurship and entrepreneurial success through education, it is important to understand that while the evidence supporting the links between education and entrepreneurial outcomes is promising it is not yet definitive.
Originality/value – In addition to providing a review of existing research this paper suggests an integrative framework for future research.","Literature review","Published: 2008, Start page: 239"

Design/methodology/approach – The paper uses data from the UK's Global Entrepreneurship Monitor surveys between 2001 and 2003 to assess the scale of equity finance in the UK. It further examines the strengths and weaknesses of the UK financial markets for supporting high growth potential firms on the basis of an additional survey of 60 experts conducted during September and October 2003.
Findings – The paper suggests that there are areas of the market that are strongly served by existing financial mechanisms. However, there is a perception amongst business support agencies, venture capitalists and entrepreneurs alike that the size of investments in the formal venture capital market has been increasing and that companies seeking investments above this level, up as high as £2 million, may be restricted in their access to finance. The paper tests this qualitative finding on a number of empirical data sources and finds that there is indeed an “equity gap” of between £150,000 and £1.5 million. It concludes that lack of finance in this area represents a brake on the expansion of high growth potential businesses in the UK.
Research limitations/implications – The empirical data covered in this paper are from three large‐scale surveys of the adult population in the UK. While this is robust as a reflection of what is happening amongst the whole spectrum of business start‐up activity, the methodology was not originally conceptualised as a mechanism for assessing the scale of the equity gap. This evidence was gained from a qualitative survey of actors in the market. Further research should survey high growth potential firms and financiers themselves in more detail to develop the analysis on a more systematic basis.
Practical implications – The research will be of interest to policy makers who seek appropriate mechanism for developing a funding “ladder” to support businesses through the growth process. It identifies a clear gap in the market for growth finance that is evidence on which to base funding priorities in the future.
Originality/value – Academic and policy attempts to quantify the scale of the equity gap in the UK have been limited by availability of longitudinal and systematic data. As a result, they have tended to be largely qualitative in nature and prone to anecdote. Many of these studies do corroborate the findings reported here, but this does represent a first attempt to provide a quantification of the equity gap and thus should be of interest to policy makers, practitioners and academics alike.","Research paper","Published: 2006, Start page: 7"

Gibb offers a critical assessment of the ways in which small business theory and research and policy making have handled the transfer of ideas as a basis for small business support policies. The arguments offered are hard hitting and persuasive, especially as an explanation for the poor record of support programmes in transitional economies. This response extends Gibb’s arguments, drawing out some implications. For instance, one of his themes is that small business theorising and research needs to give more attention to cultural and non‐economic phenomena, and this paper suggests ways in which this needs to occur. It concludes that, by accepting Gibb’s arguments, policy making would be more effective and small business theorising and research would be stronger, achieving closer relations with other social science disciplines.","Idea generation, Knowledge transfer, Small‐ to medium‐sized enterprises, National cultures","MCB UP Ltd","Published: 2000, Start page: 199"

Design/methodology/approach – This paper investigates governmental, economic, and technological supports that comprise the innovation ecology of 34 nations using ordinary least squares, discriminant analysis, and mediated regression. It is proposed that the strength of a country's innovation ecology is associated with greater sustainable entrepreneurial growth opportunities. Innovation indicators and trend analyses were collected from Eurostat Yearbook 2007, Science and Technology, and Global Financial Data over the 1995‐2005 period.
Findings – The results reveal that while the influence of government and the economic environment encourage innovation ecology, having resources at the research and development levels, human capital, and early seed funding were key indicators of innovation. The greater the degree of research and development, the availability of a highly skilled labor force, and the amount of private and public venture capital funding, the more likely it is that a strong national innovation ecology will emerge leading to the creation of new business ideas and growth opportunities.

The initial sections of this article set out the circumstances surrounding the decision to privatise and the reasons why this was executed via a MEBO. It moves on to examine the reasons for the decision to float the company on the stock exchange in the mid‐1980s. This was a period when the initial structure of the company came increasingly into question, and the paper analyses the structural imbalances that arose as the company grew very rapidly and the tensions this created between the core values that underpinned the company’s initial success and the need to take a more “hard‐nosed’ approach if that growth was not to falter. Not only was the question of the most appropriate managerial “style” brought into question, but also whether institutional investors should be allowed to displace employee ownership. Another critical issue was whether the “internationalisation” strategy was an appropriate way for the company to trade its way out of trouble. The paper concludes that environmental factors have forced the company to evolve into something far more conventional than was either intended or desired at the time of the buy‐out.","Buyouts, Privatization, Shareholders, Employees","MCB UP Ltd","Published: 1998, Start page: 102"

If SMEs are to maintain and improve their competitive position, a more proactive stance is required in relation to new technology investment. The identification and removal of barriers to adoption could greatly aid small firm investment in new technology. The internal investment appraisal process has been identified as one of the major barriers to the adoption of new manufacturing technologies in large firms (Price et al., 1990; Finnie, 1988). Little, however, is known about how SMEs conduct investment appraisals. Further, where SMEs seek external funds, they face additional appraisal by the funding institution. Research (Joyce et a/., 1990; Watkins and Morton, 1992) has indicated that SMEs view financing difficulties as a major barrier to investment. Given the nature of new manufacturing technologies, it is anticipated that such investments may create specific financing problems, particularly in relation to the appraisal by the financial institution. The focus of this paper, therefore, is on these two potential barriers to investment. Firstly, the paper investigates the extent to which the appraisal problems faced by large organisations are common to SMEs and establishes the extent to which the appraisal methods advocated in the literature are relevant to SMEs. Secondly, it examines external constraints on the financing of new technology investments from the firm perspective. In examining these barriers, the paper identifies the characteristics of the investment and financing decision‐making processes in SMEs. The main findings of the research project, involving case studies of 15 SMEs in the South East, are that SMEs do face problems in appraising and justifying new technology investments. However, these difficulties appear to cause fewer problems for SMEs in terms of the outcomes of the appraisal process than might be expected. Surprisingly, the financing of new technologies was not found to constitute a significant barrier to investment and few of the firms had experienced any real difficulties in raising finance for this purpose. The reasons for these apparent conditions are explored in depth and factors affecting the results are identified.","General review","Sarah Austin,  (1994)  ""BARRIERS TO INVESTMENT: THE APPRAISAL AND FINANCING OF NEW MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGIES IN SMEs"", Journal of Small Business and Enterprise Development, Vol. 1 Issue: 1, pp.38-46, https://doi.org/10.1108/eb020931","Published: 1994, Start page: 3"

A total of 380 questionnaires were received representing 16.8 per cent response rate. A structural equation modelling analysis is carried out on the sample.FindingsThe study finds positive and significant associations between the firm’s growth ambition and the pursuance of product and business model innovations. Moreover, the firm’s export degree and scope has a significant and positive association with its product innovation strategy, but the association with its business model innovation is significantly negative.Research limitations/implicationsThe study’s findings indicate that future studies should incorporate different types of innovation strategies since their associations with export performance differ substantially. Treating innovation as a general construct appears to be too simplistic.Practical implicationsThe study’s results indicate that focus on product innovation enhances the export performance of SMEs, but that focus on business model innovation has a negative impact. The latter may be too costly and distract focus from the firm’s core competences, whereas product innovation can be assumed to provide further competitive strength.Originality/valueBy taking a holistic approach towards innovation, this study addresses a gap in the literature on innovation and exporting in SMEs in order to investigate the association between different types of innovation-based growth strategies and the firms’ export prosperity.","Research paper","Published: 2017, Start page: 670"

The scientific responsibility rests with its authors. Preliminary versions of this paper were presented at the European Summer University 2006 on entrepreneurship and entrepreneurship education research (Hameenlinna), at ERIM workshop “Perspectives on the Longitudinal Analysis of New Firm Growth” in 2005 (Rotterdam) and, at Center for Research in Entrepreneurial Change and Innovative Strategies (CRECIS) – Louvain School of Management Seminar in 2006 (Louvain‐la‐Neuve).

Design/methodology/approach – The authors analyze the development during their initial years of existence of the population of all firms in Belgium which are more than three years old and have grown above micro‐firm size between 1992 and 2002 (n=2,152). The authors measure the evolution over time of three basic economic data (number of employees, sales and assets) and seven financial data (value added, operating income, current income, net income, cash flow, working capital and shareholders' equity).
Findings – A taxonomy was identified defined around four stable typical growth trajectories. These trajectories were adopted by a majority of firms in the sample and were not related to firm size or industry affiliation.
Originality/value – The paper's findings confirm, using an original empirical approach, previous results related to early growth and highlight the oversimplification of the life‐cycle approaches often used by practitioners and policy makers. They also open interesting research avenues regarding the endogenous and exogenous factors explaining the adoption of a given trajectory by a firm as well as why the trajectories identified are relatively stable over time.","Research paper","Published: 2011, Start page: 194"

This study seeks to represent the first, in‐depth analysis of future entrepreneurs and to show that its results indicate that the investment in entrepreneurship education is valuable.
Design/methodology/approach – A primary survey was conducted among first‐year Business Studies students from Australia, Portugal, Finland, Germany, Slovenia, Poland, the UK and the UAE. There were a total of 860 students, of whom 510 were female respondents. A five‐point Likert scale was used for each question and mean scores were generated from the ranks.
Findings – Results indicated that the majority of students possessed entrepreneurial attitudes. Furthermore, both student characteristics and entrepreneurial experience were found to be associated with certain entrepreneurial attitudes. The results show that the young female students in Dubai are positive regarding the role that universities can play in fostering their interest towards entrepreneurship, for their education and as the incubator for their new venture.
Practical implications – Significant scope was found for promotion of entrepreneurship in the education system in the United Arab Emirates. Emirati female students showed a high inclination to become entrepreneurs, provided that they undertook a specialized entrepreneurial Business Program. This research shows that students have a positive attitude towards entrepreneurship and it provides evidence, which urges action to advance entrepreneurship education globally.
Originality/value – Both academia and practitioners have increased their efforts in promoting an entrepreneurial mindset within society. However, only a few studies have investigated entrepreneurial attitudes among students. This research shows that students have a positive attitude towards entrepreneurship and it provides evidence which urges action to advance entrepreneurship education globally.","Research paper","Published: 2010, Start page: 500"

Specifically, the paper analyses the relationship between dispensary software vendors and the independent community pharmacist; and explore dominant industry partners' influence on individual pharmacies in terms of technology adoption. The core objective is to ascertain whether the potential for a cooperative construct can be realised in this milieu. Design/methodology/approach – A comprehensive literature review precedes a full investigation and analysis of the Irish community pharmacy sector's competitive environment, in the context of the pre‐mentioned power relationship theory. Findings – This research uncovered a potential alternative to the industry's existing power imbalance in the form of a cooperative construct between a team of independent community pharmacists and an employed software vendor. The purpose of this partnership was to ensure the installed software focused on the pharmacist's strategic needs rather than those of the dominant partners. The paper goes on to discuss the failure of this partnership in the context of independent pharmacist's future competitive survival. Research limitations/implications – Data collection was limited to the community pharmacy sector in the Republic of Ireland. Therefore, care should be taken in making generalisations from this study. Practical implications – In the absence of cooperative constructs, power relationship imbalances will continue to exist in this competitive environment, to the detriment of the small firm. Originality/value – Little research has been completed in the area of small business cooperative constructs as a means of competing successfully in a power relationship scenario.

Results appear to confirm that, as SME businesses grow, they develop their strategy to seek specialisation and differentiation of their products and services and diversification of their customer base. However, the paper suggests caution about any government policies based on local intervention. It suggests that policy assisted areas have no association with different local competitive conditions or advantage/disadvantage. Instead, the paper suggests that firms increasingly obtain competitive advantage from developing trading relationships with other regions or countries beyond their own locality. Consequently policy assistance should be tailored closely to the needs of the SME rather than the locality.","Research paper","Published: 2002, Start page: 7"

All errors, omissions and conclusions remain the sole responsibility of the authors.","Purpose – The aims of the paper are three‐fold: first, to analyse how small and micro firms finance themselves; second, to investigate what their financing preferences are; and third, to explore their opinions on how they evaluate the financing sources and the various obstacles they face in accessing those sources.
Design/methodology/approach – The paper uses a sample of Greek small and micro firms, which cover 99.6 per cent of the total number of firms operating in Greece. The data are derived from the answers in a structured questionnaire.
Findings – The main conclusions are as follows. Regarding equity financing, firms rely heavily on their own funds and would not raise new equity from sources outside the family; thus, there is a reluctance to use new outside equity (venture capital, business angels, etc.). Regarding debt financing, firms denoted that they would use more debt, specifically long‐term debt, than they currently do. Thus, there are limitations in accessing long‐term debt financing. Regarding grant financing, micro and small firms should be better informed and encouraged more to participate in state grants and co‐financed programs; thus, there is an informational gap in grant financing.
Originality/value – The paper uses a sample of Greek micro and small firms and a survey methodology to tackle the lack of quantitative published data for most small firms in Greece. It incorporates distinct sources of funds that are very important for small firms (family funds, grants provided by the state and micro‐loans). It investigates preferences, not just practices.","Research paper","Published: 2013, Start page: 8"

Generally, the immediate issues concern the factors that influence the development of owners and managers of growing and sustainable small businesses, considered by many to be the source of future innovation and jobs in both developed and developing economies. More particularly, the survey is part of a wider investigation into management development in Britain, and the paper parallels a previous analysis of statistical determinants based on a survey of larger businesses. While entrepreneurship has received a lot of attention in small business research, comparatively little attention has been paid to the development of management competencies in small firms. In the study reported here, regression analyses were used to develop a more detailed understanding of the factors which shape the amount and nature of management development in small businesses. The key research questions, in line with the previous analysis, are: (1) what are the relative importance of environmental and structural factors on the one hand, and strategic factors such as internal management development policy on the other, in explaining the amount and value of management development activity? (2) what does this tell us about the degree to which management development is determined by choice or circumstance? (3) what are the “drivers” of management development and their relative significance?

Although originally viewed as a means of reducing business risk, the ownership of multiple businesses by a single entrepreneur is now recognised as an important business growth strategy. Although studies specifically examining portfolio entrepreneurship are still scarce, the similarities between portfolio entrepreneurship in non‐farm sectors and farm‐based pluriactivity have been noted. Based on a survey of nearly 300 farm owners in Cambridgeshire, this study analyses the incidence of portfolio entrepreneurship in the farm sector and assesses its contribution in terms enterprise and employment creation. The study demonstrates that a core of farmers have multiple business interests and that these additional business activities make a substantial contribution to both numbers of enterprises and employment creation. The results of this study challenge three basic assumptions. First, contrary to the prevailing view within the small business literature, some farm businesses were found to spawn a number of additional businesses and create substantial new employment opportunities. Secondly, new enterprise and employment creation was not confined to larger sized (hectarage) farm businesses. Finally, the results challenge the orthodox assumption that employment creation in the small firms sector arises principally through the move into self‐employment by new entrepreneurs.","Growth, Portfolio planning, Entrepreneurialism, Employment, Agriculture","MCB UP Ltd","Published: 1998, Start page: 297"

This paper reports the findings of a European Social Fund (ESF) Objective 4 project, which was carried out throughout 1998/1999. Fourteen innovative, technology‐based small and medium‐sized enterprises were interviewed with the aim of investigating the processes currently in place to aid in the establishment of a skilled workforce, and the extent to which future skill requirements were identified. The research methodology involved a series of semi‐structured interviews with owner‐managers, managing directors and other staff within the sample companies. The first interview, involving 20 companies, allowed general company information to be collected and interviewees were questioned about business planning and those factors considered to be of strategic importance. The second interview, involving 14 of the original 20 companies, investigated human resource issues in depth. Respondents provided information about staff recruitment, retention and training and the extent to which these issues were integrated into strategic plans. The study used Investors in People (IiP) guidelines to identify potential models of best practice and therefore to aid in the production of the research questionnaire. It was found that the majority of respondent companies did not use a sophisticated approach to identify current and future staffing needs.

Research shows that many small businesses fail from lack of management ability. It has been argued that small businesses can improve their performance and increase their competitiveness with better information and decision support systems (DSS). Study of the few research papers available reveals that the current use of computers in small and medium‐size enterprises (SMEs) is often limited, and geared to operational support rather than managerial decision making. The work discussed in this paper investigated current DSS use in small manufacturing businesses in Bedfordshire, and canvassed the views of managers as to what additional support they most needed. Conclusions are drawn from the results of interviews with managers of six small manufacturing businesses and a large‐scale self‐report survey of Bedfordshire firms.","Decision‐support systems, Small‐ to medium‐sized enterprises, Manufacturing industry, Computers, Information systems","MCB UP Ltd","Published: 2000, Start page: 199"

Blundel  (Senior Lecturer in Strategic Management at Oxford Brookes University Business School)","This paper presents new insights into the growth of small and medium‐sized enterprises (SMEs) engaged in vertical inter‐firm relationships. It adopts a processual and resource‐based perspective and focuses on the experiences of fresh produce businesses which have achieved high rates of growth while supplying the UK’s large multiple food retailers. The context in which these suppliers operate is shown to be a complex and dynamic supply chain, characterised by increasing structural concentration and close vertical linkages. The primary research investigates how certain SMEs have prospered in an apparently “hostile” environment. It includes a programme of matched‐depth interviews, conducted across the retailer‐supplier dyad. Content analysis of transcripts reveals six factors which appear to be strongly associated with the formation of “successful” relationships. In subsequent interactions, securing “developmental” supplier status appears to open the way to a self‐reinforcing cycle of Penrosian learning and reinvestment. This cycle contributes to growth in the supplier firm. The authors argue that, with certain crucial caveats, growth‐oriented SMEs can develop mutually beneficial relationships with much larger “customer” firms. The paper concludes by drawing out wider policy implications and indicating how this contextualised approach might be used in other contexts.","Small‐ to medium‐sized enterprises, Growth, Supplier relations, Retailers, Food industry, Supply chain","MCB UP Ltd","Published: 2001, Start page: 205"

They provide needed products and services, new opportunities for employment, and general vitality. The economic impact these businesses have on their town and county are important indicators of an area’s success. The purpose of this paper is to examine newly started small businesses that are within three or four years of age or less, and examine factors that may have led to their success or failure. Here, sources of advice, means of financial support, and background experience of the firm’s founder have been found to be correlated with the business success.Design/methodology/approachThe analysis using Probit regression yielded four models wherein female owners, family help with a business and Hispanic ownership had significant models predicting performance all of these were negative relationships. The factors correlated with business success as proposed are presented. Of course correlation does not imply causation, which means that the authors cannot be sure that a factor that is associated with business success will lead to business success. But, this is an important first step in determining whether there are significant differences between successful and unsuccessful businesses.FindingsThe findings showed that experience with previous business ownership had a distinct impact and the marketing efforts were also important for profitability. The other factors were not significant. A second phase to the analysis using Probit regression yielded four models wherein female owners, family help with a business and Hispanic ownership had significant models predicting performance all of these were negative relationships. This represents the difficulties that are encountered with these groups in garnering the support and financial means they need to succeed. It was also interesting that the use of a business plan did not help the businesses succeed.Research limitations/implicationsUsing a Probit Regression and χ2 analysis of the data is the most appropriate and accurate analysis for a date set of this type. There is much more to be accomplished with rural entrepreneurship and the use of these techniques would be appropriate for this type of data.Practical implicationsBusiness plans are important for the business founder to predict potential costs and profits. In this study however, the authors did not find that having a business plan differentiated business’s performance. If it can be replicated, it will be important to find out what is unique about rural areas that lead to this finding. If business plans do not help, then what type of preplanning will help? If this finding is correct, business development agencies may wish to cut back resources devoted to writing a business plan, and devote them to other areas. Being a member of business network group also is not associated with business success.Social implicationsThe growth of rural entrepreneurial businesses is well documented. These businesses provide many social impacts to the local community not only by providing products or services need but also by providing employment. This research is imperative to providing the best success plan for these businesses as the proliferate.Originality/valueThere has been very little research on rural entrepreneurship. This study takes a unique look at a rural community and the success or failure of their businesses over a one-year period when most small businesses succeed or fail. There is much more to be done on examining the tools they need to be successful.","Research paper","Published: 2017, Start page: 198"

Design/methodology/approach – A survey of 600 small Australian businesses, conducted by CPA Australia in March 2002 to explore employment issues, is analysed by the authors.
Findings – The analysis shows that growth‐oriented small firms are more likely than non‐growing ones to use formal HRM practices where that means that they are written down, regularly applied or assured to take place.
Research limitations/implications – The data are a single snapshot of small firms in time (March 2002) and therefore, while non‐growing small firms can be identified amongst the sample, it is not correct to assume either that they have not grown in the past to reach their current size (with the exception of the single person firms) or that they will not grow in the future. Moreover it is not known whether the growth, which the growing small firms indicate they undertook, was or is sustained.
Practical implications – The result suggests that small firms seeking growth should reconsider their HRM practices in light of their business plans to ensure that there is a good “fit”.
Originality/value – The authors examine small firms in Australia, which are much smaller than their international counterparts, to see whether conclusions from overseas studies are relevant.","Research paper","Published: 2007, Start page: 168"

Design/methodology/approach – The empirical (quantitative) investigation is based on a sample of 64 SMEs in the UK – 33 “open” innovation firms and 31 “closed” innovation firms.
Findings – The overall results demonstrate that the international competitiveness of SMEs is highly dependent on the cumulative effects and interrelationship between two key internal components, i.e. R&D capacity and managerial structure and competencies, coupled with two external factors, i.e. open innovation practices and the ability of the firm to attract government grants for R&D and technological development.
Research limitations/implications – Owing to the size of the sample, it has not been possible to undertake research within the context of specific regional disparities and/or sectoral characteristics.
Practical implications – In order to achieve and sustain competitive advantage in today's global market, SMEs need to collaborate with universities and other firms to advance and commercialise their technologies through “open innovation”.
Originality/value – Results show that open innovation activities and their impact on the international competitiveness of SMEs are complex and multi‐faceted. Essentially, they are highly related to and dependent upon the cumulative effects of, and interrelationship between, several key internal and external factors. Such factors cannot be fully explored through qualitative approaches as they require more complex and rigorous statistical analyses.","Research paper","Published: 2013, Start page: 249"

Barriers to the adoption of e‐business technologies and techniques are discussed, together with factors that promote successful adoption, and the major role played by human capital. It is concluded that the take‐up of e‐business by SMEs needs to be seen as a means to an end and not an end in itself.

In particular, generalised notions, recipes and tool‐kits of techniques for how small business managers should be developed can easily be dismissed as irrelevant by the small business managers themselves. This would suggest a methodological gap which highlights the failure of many interventionist frameworks. Argues that this gap can be bridged by taking a social constructionist view to supporting small business managers and the development of their organisations. Provides an introduction to the key ideas of social constructionism and their relevance to understanding the support process underpinning the development of managers in smaller businesses. Concludes with a discussion of the implications of social constructionism for those involved in researching, evaluating and developing services to support management development in small business organisations.","Learning, Small firms, Management development","MCB UP Ltd","Published: 2002, Start page: 100"

The paper uses a broadly based definition of networks that focuses on the exploitation of both formal and informal relationships for business development purposes, which includes social networks as well as voluntary and necessary business‐based linkages. More specifically, the paper considers the role of networking in raising capital, recruiting labour, identifying and finding customers, as well as accessing business support. The results show that personal and community‐based networks are used both to mobilise resources and to generate sales by business owners in all groups, although the nature and extent of the activity varies at different stages of business development. As other studies have shown, there is a very low level of take‐up of business advice and support from mainstream support agencies by these ethnic minority enterprises, not because of a lack of awareness but because of a range of negative attitudes towards them.","Networking, Ethnic groups, small firms, Entreprenuers","MCB UP Ltd","Published: 2000, Start page: 199"

Interviews were conducted by a research team comprising Alan Cardow, Claire Massey, Martin Perry and David Tweed (all of Massey University). Angela Yates of the NZ Centre of SME Research provided research assistance.","Purpose – Through the dual analysis of small business‐owner relations with their banks and accountants, this paper aims to address conflicting interpretations of how small business owners may optimise their banking relationships.
Design/methodology/approach – Site visits were made to 49 small firms which had been recruited from a random sample of 500 New Zealand firms that employed up to 50 full‐time equivalent staff. An interview was then carried out with the owner‐manager of the firm.
Findings – The study identifies four bank relationship types: serial switching, independence, relationship chasing, and switched off. Consistent with previous research, dissatisfaction with existing relations is frequent but switching is infrequent. Rather than switch bank, the predominant reaction is to reduce the use of bank services. The disadvantage this creates is offset by the development of a closer relationship with business's accountant.
Research limitations/implications – The findings are limited in their ability to be generalised due to the research methodology and research context. However, the conclusions will be of interest to researchers and managers in banks and accountancy firms.
Originality/value – The paper addresses a gap in the knowledge base surrounding enterprise‐bank relationships. Whereas most previous research has focused on the small enterprise‐bank relationship, the present study includes the relationship between small enterprises and accountants based on the assumption that they can offer similar advice and support.","Research paper","Published: 2009, Start page: 196"

While the liability of smallness has been a recurring theme in research into public sector suppliers, there remains a dearth of evidence and theorising on the effects of size.Design/methodology/approachA model linking firm size, resources, capabilities, tendering activity and performance is devised. Resource-based view theory informs the model. Survey data from over 3,000 firms active in the Irish public sector marketplace is used to test the model.FindingsAs hypothesised, firm size is positively associated with tendering resources and capabilities. Resources and capabilities, in turn, influence tendering activity and performance.

A questionnaire was sent to a sample of 30 LEA managers (10% of all LEAs) covering their understanding of LEAs' market ‘positioning’, promotional activity and client targeting. The findings show that the application of formal marketing approaches is weak, even among LEA managers who possess marketing qualifications. It seems unlikely that potentially successful entrepreneurs are seen as a target market by LEA staff or are actively attracted to take advantage of the facilities and services available. Local Enterprise Agencies emphasize the importance of capabilities in business planning, in their clients. However, entrepreneurs are, in general, notably weak in this business function and LEAs may therefore be de‐selecting entrepreneurs in their selection procedures.

In Europe, agriculture has faced increasing pressures for restructuring: facilitation of marketing and entrepreneurial skills of farmers and a stronger entrepreneurial orientation have been suggested as a possible solution for the emerging problems. The purpose of this paper is to examine the concept of entrepreneurial capability of farmers to diversify. The central focus of this article is on the entrepreneurial identity of portfolio farmers in Finland and the extent to which the differences between portfolio farmers, other farmers, and non‐farm rural businesses can be explained.
Design/methodology/approach – The subjects of the study were rural small‐business owner‐managers and farmers in Finland. The authors carried out a survey of random samples from three populations, each representing a broad cross‐section of relevant industries, including a sample of non‐farm rural entrepreneurs (n=590) and portfolio farmers (n=2,200).
Findings – It emerges that portfolio farmers have a stronger entrepreneurial identity than conventional farmers. Compared to conventional farmers, the portfolio farmers in the sample perceive themselves as growth‐oriented, risk‐takers, innovative, optimistic and having more personal control upon their business activities.

The purpose of this paper is to propose indicators measuring the impact that these processes in general, and support actions in particular, have on individuals.
Design/methodology/approach – Existing theories that could be used to analyze the impact of nascent venture experiences on individuals are reviewed. Literature and official statements regarding the underlying objectives of different stakeholders in company creation in France are then presented. Following this, performance indicators used by researchers and French support networks are discussed in relation to these objectives.
Findings – It is shown that indicators that could provide information regarding the potential effects of startup processes on individuals exist but remain to be used with nascent entrepreneurs. A proposal as to how these indicators might be adapted to the specific needs of nascent entrepreneurship research is made.
Research limitations/implications – The indicators proposed here are identified in a review of the literature, in which studies are primarily undertaken on student samples. Their practical adaptation to populations of nascent entrepreneurs remains to be implemented.
Practical implications – The suggested indicators should be of use to professional support actors who constantly look to improve their service to nascent entrepreneurs. They should also provide valuable information to the individuals considering or involved in startups on how to use support more efficiently, to policy makers for assessing the impact of specific support efforts and to academics designing entrepreneurship programmes.
Originality/value – The paper proposes readily applicable indicators for nascent entrepreneurship outcomes by drawing on a variety of research streams and linking them to practical information.","Conceptual paper","Published: 2011, Start page: 194"

This paper explores how HRM practices of small firms change as the size of the firm increases. Using data from micro, small and medium firms in Queensland, Australia, the paper reviews the recruitment and selection practices, training methods, performance appraisal and the maintenance of HR records and policies in these firms. The findings indicate a move towards hierarchical structures, increased documentation and more administrative processes as the number of employees increases. The increase is rapid initially and then occurs at a slower pace thereafter. Such changes have implications for the management of the employment relationship. The paper concludes that HRM practices in small firms cannot be portrayed by a standardised description and that management training and advice for small firms must recognise the diversity associated with this important sector of the Australian economy.","Small enterprises, Human resource management, Business development, Australia","Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Published: 2004, Start page: 427"

Opinions (and the potential errors) expressed in this paper are, of course, the author's alone.","Purpose – This paper aims to identify four “types” of private small and medium‐sized enterprises (SMEs) with regard to their “state” along the exporting experience spectrum.
Design/methodology/approach – This exploratory study explores survey information from a historic comparative static longitudinal database. Survey information was gathered in 1990/1991 from a stratified random sample of 621 manufacturing, construction and services businesses located in 12 contrasting environments in Great Britain. Surviving firms were re‐interviewed in 1997. The propensity to export was monitored at two points in real time. Information relating to actual behaviour rather than solely attitudes was gathered.
Findings – Strategic obstacles to exporting were not more likely to be cited by respondents in “disinterested exporter” rather than “disappointed exporter” firms. Also, a reactive exporting strategy was not more likely to be cited by respondents in “export capable” rather then “committed exporter” firms. Several statistically significant differences were detected with regard to the profiles of non‐exporting “disinterested exporter” and “disappointed exporter” firms, and exporting “export capable” and “committed exporter” firms.
Practical implications – Assuming an interventionist stance, this study suggests that practitioners need to consider the exporting experience profiles of SMEs. Practitioners seeking to increase the pool of exporting SMEs in local communities need to address an array of barriers, and not solely strategic barriers.
Originality/value – Guided by insights from traditional internationalization theory and international entrepreneurship theory, two hypotheses were derived relating to obstacles impeding export activity, and reasons cited for exporting. Evidence from a comparative statistic longitudinal base relating to firms scattered throughout Great Britain was explored. Multivariate logistic regression analysis detected differences with reference to firm export “type”.","Research paper","Published: 2008, Start page: 431"

The focus is a co‐operative development initiative whose history is traced from its origins in the early 1980s, when the process aims of co‐operation were arguably as important as commercial success, to its current form with a more avowedly business ethos. The interviews had, as their principal purpose, to discover whether support could be provided and in what way, and what differences existed between assistance for the entrepreneur and the owner‐manager. A discussion of the distinction between entrepreneurs and owner‐managers provides a basis for analysing the firms in the study. Owner‐management rather than entrepreneurship is argued to be the more appropriate frame and support initiatives are discussed mainly in that context.

Design/methodology/approach – The research utilized a quantitative survey covering 49 retailing, manufacturing and tourism‐oriented organizations to ascertain whether small organizations practice the procedures and methods outlined in the prescriptive literature on recruitment and training compared with large organizations. Institutional theory and resource‐based view informed the research.
Findings – It was found that recruitment processes and methods and training practices vary among small and large organizations. It suggests that, in Barbados, small businesses are likely to rely on informal recruitment methods and informal training practices compared with large businesses.
Research limitations/implications – This study is only conducted across the retailing, manufacturing and tourism sectors in Barbados. The findings may have implications for management in other sectors, and small and large businesses in emerging economies.

Two broad themes are discernible in this work. On the one hand there are those who argue that the speed of change is so fast that organisations and managers who can respond almost instinctively and improvise responses quickly will do well. On the other, there are those who argue that more formalised systems of strategic development and control are needed to give organisations a competitive advantage. The results from an empirical study of some 267 organisations are used to shed some light on this debate. The evidence supports the idea that a growing organisation is associated with the existence of internal strategic systems that support the firm’s growth ambitions, allowing it to make not only “good” business decisions and to monitor how well the organisations is doing against its strategy, but to do so speedily.","Decision making, Strategy, Innovation, Planning, Growth, Small‐ to medium‐sized enterprises","MCB UP Ltd","Published: 2003, Start page: 128"

Design/methodology/approach – The paper presents an empirical study using factorial and regression analysis to measure which components of the global risk of SMEs are linked to accounting beta.
Findings – The results show that accounting beta does not seem to constitute a global measure of SMEs' risk, being explained mostly by financial risk and not by commercial, technological, management and entrepreneurial risks components.
Research limitations/implications – Researchers will have to turn towards other models than accounting beta that include financial and nonfinancial dimensions of risk in order to obtain an adequate assessment of the overall SMEs' risk.
Practical implications – Risk is the element that determines access to external financing as well as the lending conditions. Results obtained in this research show that accounting data cannot be used to express overall risk of SMEs, because they are not global enough and are not good predictors of future situations.

Additionally, it discusses government initiatives which seek to develop SME competitiveness through encouraging increased take‐up of management development. Helping SMEs to develop and grow is important to the national economy and a number of government initiatives are now in place to meet this need. Developing people in line with business objectives is a priority which the government is promoting through the Investors in People process and the acquisition of National Vocational Qualifications. However, the style of SMEs is focused upon short‐term activist priorities of obtaining business while the longer term strategic view, of which people development is a significant part, tends to be an overlooked area. The paper reviews the current literature regarding the contribution of SMEs to the UK economy and the relationship of management training to SME performance. The authors identify a need for research investigating the level of awareness amongst SMEs of the opportunities available to them for developing their staff, their attitudes toward the range of initiatives and options, and the degree of take‐up. A greater understanding of the adequacy and appropriateness of government approaches to SME development would allow agencies which can support SMEs, such as Training and Enterprise Councils, Regional Development Agencies and providers of training and development, to target their assistance more effectively.","Small‐ to medium‐sized enterprises, Management development, Competences, NVQs","MCB UP Ltd","Published: 1998, Start page: 102"

(2001) that examined the challenges faced by SMEs along their path of internationalization. In particular, the internationalization process in transitional and developed economies is examined.
Design/methodology/approach – The central research methodology for the project uses a qualitative approach involving the in‐depth investigation of a “critical incident.” The incident explored is the firm's “worst nightmare” or “biggest challenge” in conducting international business. Respondents are asked to “tell the story” of the “critical incident”, its nature and consequences.
Findings – SME exporters in the transitional economy encountered export problems related to product quality acceptance and logistics management. In comparison, SME exporters in the developed economy faced issues such as country differences, general business risk, and logistics.
Research limitations/implications – The research methodology provides both limitations and benefits. This type of in‐depth critical incident analysis lends itself to small sample sizes, in this paper 29 cases. The limitation is the generalizability of the findings because of the small sample. The benefit is that the methodology yields an in‐depth understanding of the challenges faced by SME exporters.
Originality/value – This paper extends earlier work examining challenges faced by SMEs by comparing the experiences of managers in two different economic environments and finding differences in their respective challenges.","Research paper","Published: 2006, Start page: 476"

Although it is generally accepted that most small firms in the UK sell to local markets, SMEs based within the Aberdeen area of Scotland play an important role in exporting and employment. The potential for birth and growth of firms exists in a number of targeted key sectors which aid the economic development of the Aberdeen area. However, assistance is required to bring people together in order to encourage networking, and this paper seeks to explore the process of facilitating an enterprise culture by examining the collaboration and partnership roles played by a LEC and a university in initiatives which foster enterprise. The relationship of the researchers and practitioners is similar to the model outlined by Oakey and Mukhtar where research and practice are used to inform each other, over time, to identify policy needs. The initiatives examined in this paper are the Entrepreneurs’ Club where established entrepreneurs mix with others at the new venture stage, and the Chrysalis Elite programme which links graduates with existing owner managers, creating a work‐based project involving groups of students. These links extend to the wider business community and organisations, including local entrepreneurs (who provide prizes and guidance), 3i and the Local Investors Network Company (LINC), who offer advice and opportunities. The main outcomes for policy in this paper are that collaboration between a LEC and a university can be very effective in assisting individuals or groups to meet the challenge of building entrepreneurial networks and that effective support can be provided for students to gain experience from the business community.","Local government services, Universities, Start‐ups, Entrepreneurialism, Networking, Partnering","MCB UP Ltd","Published: 1999, Start page: 7"

The “virtual cluster” phenomenon highlights the most significant effect of the development of the information and communication technologies in the business environment. A virtual cluster is conceived as an e‐business community, made up of customers, suppliers, distributors and commerce providers sharing digital and knowledge networks for collaboration and competition. The purpose of this paper is to set out the characteristics of a new competitive space, in which a strategic role is played by virtual processes among partners, and to review the traditional sources of clustering in the digital economy environment (Romano et al., 1999). More specifically, this paper attempts to show the emerging overlap between digital and knowledge networks, which generates a new competitive space within a new global‐virtual learning environment. Finally, assuming that traditional sources of clustering are generally identified in specialisation (based on a sophisticated division of labour) and geographic proximity, the paper discusses how the role of organisational proximity acts as a substitute for geographic proximity in supporting coordination and tacit knowledge exchange. As it emerges from the analysis of our cases, from a managerial point of view, organisational proximity may be achieved through the implementation of supply chain management (SCM) and customer relationship management (CRM) strategies.

It would appear that firms which do utilise a strategic approach, however informal, are more likely to endure. Design school strategic management techniques have traditionally been sited in, and associated with, corporate enterprises and, as such, would not be readily accessible to most small firms. Recent critics of this design school approach argue that strategic activity, in the majority of firms, is far more intuitive and flexible than previously believed and describe this as an emergent approach to strategy. If this is the case, it should be possible for most small‐firm owners and managers to harness their business skills, which evidence would suggest are likely to be intuitive, based on experience, and flexible, to develop an emergent approach to strategy. To investigate the proposition further, this paper focuses primarily upon strategic human resource management (HRM) in small firms, arguing that the efficient use of labour in small firms is a critical activity for such firms to achieve durability and if desired, growth. This paper will, therefore, briefly consider the debates surrounding design school and emergent strategies, examine the role of strategic HRM within the enterprise in some detail and then present empirical findings to illustrate these issues.","Emergent strategy, Human resource management, Business continuity","MCB UP Ltd","Published: 2000, Start page: 105"

While large companies, such as steelworks, coal mines, railways, etc, have been protected by the government for social reasons, the small and medium enterprises (SMEs) could survive only when they, by themselves or with some external assistance, were able to introduce internal changes and adjust to the market environment. Polish SMEs may be divided into two groups: emerging private firms and split firms which were created by a partition of large state‐owned enterprises. The various reasons for failure are discussed for both groups and compared with those described in the literature. A general model of consultancy intervention is presented and the attitudes of Polish enterprises towards change are described. In general, the state‐owned and split firms are reluctant to change unless their situation is critical, and if restructurisation is done it is rather superficial. Thus, a successful consultant has to be not only convincing and flexible but also must assess how deep a change is wanted by a given enterprise. This paper presents the approach used in helping the split firms by the University of Mining and Metallurgy (UMM), Faculty of Management Consulting Group. In order to find solutions for a given firm, a working team consisting of representatives of an enterprise and university was set up. The team devises a strategy of enterprise survival and prepares a detailed plan of the steps to be taken. This approach, which in many cases has proved to be successful, consists of trying to infuse the employees with the philosophy of enterprise survival and organising a series of relevant training activities. When the employees fully understand the essence of all the actions necessary for enterprise survival (privatisation, improvement of marketing, creation of systems of motivation, quality control, management information and other), the consulting group’s role as “company doctor” is limited to the supervision of the change planning process and the assessment of the solutions chosen. This system of triggering employee initiative has been found to be not only effective but also cheap, an aspect which in the case of small enterprises should not be underestimated.","Small‐ to medium‐sized enterprises, Counselling, Consultants, Organizational restructuring, Poland","MCB UP Ltd","Published: 1999, Start page: 310"

Realised manufacturing strategy can be considered to be the pattern formed in the stream of actions taken within a firm’s manufacturing function. The research aims to locate the source of that stream by identifying the causal origins of strategic manufacturing actions using a strategy charting method. The findings indicate that, for these companies, realised manufacturing strategy is predominantly formed through a bottom‐up emergent process, arising from the preferences of personnel within the manufacturing function. For most strategic manufacturing actions, there is no demonstrable link to business strategy. As such, these firms are not following best‐practice manufacturing strategy literature, which advises that manufacturing strategy be derived from business strategy in a top‐down deliberate process. This is the case despite differences in the size, products, customers, ownership structures and histories of the companies. The paper speculates that, in UK SMEs, more widely, manufacturing strategy may similarly not arise from the pursuit of business objectives. This may be because the concept of manufacturing as a potential strategic weapon is absent in the SME community, or because the formalised top‐down deliberate process of developing manufacturing strategy associated with this concept is inappropriate in the dynamic environments in which most SMEs operate.","Manufacturing strategy, Small‐ to medium‐sized enterprises, UK","MCB UP Ltd","Published: 2000, Start page: 199"

Not surprisingly, perhaps, a great deal of this research has focused on areas where EMBs are concentrated, such as London and Birmingham. In contrast, this research focuses on EMBs in an area which is some distance from the main centres of EMB concentration and where the ethnic minority population is more dispersed, many in a rural context.","Research paper","Published: 2003, Start page: 7"

The authors highlight the structure of these target firms and build a typology of corresponding business models.
Design/methodology/approach – The authors used a dataset of 38,000 young French SMEs. It is constituted of all individual and consolidated year‐end financial statements submitted by French firms to the commercial court. Data analysis techniques (principal component analysis then hierarchical and ascending classification) were used on the data.
Findings – The business models stemming from this typology are typical (to the greatest extent possible) and actionable. The authors are particularly interested in identifying groups of SMEs where government assistance would be particularly effective and strategically valuable for the national economy.
Practical implications – One of the authors' conclusions is that the typology is not based on a classical growth model that reflects progressive phases of development in the life of a young firm. Furthermore, it is ineffective and wasteful to focus government assistance efforts on firms based on their age. The authors identify groups of business models where assistance would be more efficient and strategically more effective.
Originality/value – It is notable that this paper relies not upon a sample, but upon the exhaustive collection of all available data on the subject. This research questions the allocation efficiency of governmental assistance on the basis of growth models. It intends to provide a better understanding of the criteria that should be taken into account to enhance targeting of assistance toward businesses with the greatest potential for the nation.","Research paper","Published: 2011, Start page: 194"

Even before taking up his new position, he was aware of the need for changes — the school had a bad reputation locally, the staff were unmotivated and the finance available through local authority funding was not sufficient to provide the quality of education he would wish. He developed a three and a five year plan incorporating a change of internal culture, the organisational structure, the perceived value of Garibaldi to all its stakeholders, the quality of educational experience for the youngsters and means of generating revenue for the school. The case looks at cultural change, flattening of hierarchies, the ‘bobbing cork’ organisational archetype, the entrepreneurial strategic management system, the marketing of the school and the hugely successful raising of finance, £56,000 in 1992. By early 1993 the objectives of the initial forward plans had all been met and even surpassed whilst the new head teacher had become recognised by many — including the awarders of the title ‘East Midlands Company of the Year 1992’ — as a successful entrepreneur.

The purpose of this article is to investigate whether two unconventional experiential courses, with the style and content that the authors would like to have experienced before becoming entrepreneurs, can be successfully grafted on to the more conventional offerings of a large university business school.
Design/methodology/approach – The authors create learning by allowing a small group of students with serious business ideas to actually be entrepreneurs (rather than pretending to be) as they evaluate, optimize, and start running their businesses within the university course structure. All distractions from these goals, such as formal business plans and academic exercises, are removed, and direct contact with outside stakeholders is strongly emphasized. Fellow‐students and the instructor provide constant feedback and ideas to adapt and improve the businesses.
Findings – The courses meet a variety of accepted experiential education criteria, receive highly positive student evaluations, and generate many real businesses.
Practical implications – The methodology provides a practical, scalable, and effective way to provide university education through entrepreneurship.
Originality/value – The approach described in the paper has many unusual aspects and works very well. It may be of interest to others attempting innovations in the teaching of entrepreneurship and of the enterprising mindset.","Research paper","Published: 2008, Start page: 239"

In practice, this is likely to mean more sole traders without employees, a heterogeneous group sometimes identified with, and sometimes distinguished from, small enterprises. In this paper, we confront that contradiction, drawing upon academic and policy‐oriented writing on small firms and upon a wider literature on labour markets and employment trends. Being self‐employed is not synonymous with being enterprising, but most self‐employed people will need skills associated with enterprise to survive. We overview the cultural sector, which has been identified as a key growth sector for jobs and one in which very small businesses and self‐employed individuals predominate. We explore in depth the “enterprising” behaviour of a subgroup of the cultural sector, people offering creative services to the print and broadcast media on a self‐employed basis. Our particular focus is upon how they form and manage working relationships. The expectation was that, while few would formally become employers, collaborative, colleague‐like working patterns would be adopted to avoid isolation and overcome the vulnerability of small size. This was true, but only for a very small group. For the most part, links with other self‐employed people were tentative and fraught with suspicion. Distrust was pervasive and often coexisted painfully with a desire to form new links for information seeking, sociability and to combat the commercial disadvantages of working alone. Typically, the most important working relationships were with employees of client companies, and many were determined to see these links as longterm, personal and not purely commercial. There was a marked lack of skills in negotiating and marketing.","Small firms, The arts, Entrepreneurs, Creativity, Business strategy, Broadcasting","MCB UP Ltd","Published: 2001, Start page: 301"

The paper explores the tension between advice likely to increase growth and risk‐taking and advice likely to ensure firm survival in the turbulent small and medium‐sized enterprises sector. The research data derive from 24 semi‐structured interviews and a group interview of ten business advisers in the West Midlands region collected between autumn 1996 and spring 1997, and a national survey of 175 Business Link personal business advisers (PBAs) conducted in April 1998. Interviewees responded to a prompt asking for advice to a fast‐growing firm. The paper compares qualitative interview responses from a wide variety of West Midlands business advisers with questionnaire responses from PBAs. The paper suggests that the advice given by accountants and bank managers differs little from that given by Business Link’s PBAs. The paper will argue that advisers including PBAs, offer risk‐averse advice and support to small firms. Present business advice might reduce insolvency rather than increase the number of fast‐growth firms. The risk‐averse nature of advice, reflecting the adviser’s clientele, undermines policies designed to increase the number of fast‐growth companies. It concludes that advice will often be inconsistent with the growth‐oriented aim of government policy.","Small‐ to medium‐sized enterprises, Business policy, Advisory services","MCB UP Ltd","Published: 2000, Start page: 295"

Antrim, Northern Ireland)","Attention has been drawn recently to the differences which exist between family and non‐family firms, but Ward indicates that there are different types of family firms. More specifically, as Dunn puts it, “in some families it is evident that the business serves the family, as opposed to the family serves the business”. For some families in business, economic rationality dominates decision making, yet for others a “family first” ethos is to the fore, while a third group recognises the need to respond to economic and family considerations. In this paper firms which pay attention to both family and business are not investigated. However, Ward’s model of the characteristics of family firms is discussed and data based on a Scottish and Irish sample of 234 firms which put family first when business and family objectives clash, and 830 firms which focus on business objectives, are presented. Results suggest that the former exhibit several of the characteristics defined by Ward. This suggests that a considerable number of family firms may be lifestyle – as opposed to growth‐oriented businesses. These results have major implications for policy makers. If a substantial number of family firms differ from rational economic ventures by their methods of operation, then policy makers should be flexible with regard to the methods of intervention required to support this important section of the SME community. Policy issues in connection with family firms in Britain are considered in the light of our findings.","Family firms, Business policy, Company philosophy","MCB UP Ltd","Published: 1999, Start page: 7"

Cadbury’s suggestion to strengthen the independent governance role has led to particular interest in non‐executive directors (NEDs). More recently, the role of NEDs in the governance of small and medium‐size enterprises (SMEs) has started to generate attention, and a number of registers of NEDs are established. Indeed, the role of NEDs in SMEs received special attention in the recent Hampel report (1998). Until recently, only two papers directly addressed the role of NEDs in SMEs; both papers were by Mileham and used data obtained from a survey concerned with the role of NEDs carried out with Institute of Management members. This research made a useful contribution, but had a number of limitations. More recently, the increased interest in the role of NEDs in SMEs has sparked further research, but there is still a need for an overall picture of NED and mentor involvement in UK SMEs. The research in this paper addresses this need by presenting the results from a survey sent to 5,279 UK SMEs selected from the Yellow Pages Business Database. The questionnaire was designed to provide a general overview of NED and mentor involvement in SMEs and to allow the following questions to be answered: How many SMEs have NEDs, and are there any firm size patterns? Are there firm age patterns? Are there firm sector patterns? Does firm size influence the formality of NED procedures? What does the managing director believe NEDs add? Are firms with NEDs more successful than those without a NED? Does the profile of the managing director matter? Does a firm’s size influence NED involvement? How do firms acquire NEDs? Why do some SMEs not have NEDs? The paper presents these findings and explores the implications for SMEs and policy advisors.","Small‐ to medium‐sized enterprises, Non‐executive directors, Mentors","MCB UP Ltd","Published: 2001, Start page: 113"

Philanthropy is part of the implicit social contract that continuously nurtures and revitalizes economic prosperity. Much of the new wealth created historically has been given back to the community, to build up the great social institutions that have a positive feedback on future economic growth. This entrepreneurship‐philanthropy nexus has not been fully explored by either economists or the general public. The purpose of this paper is to suggest that US philanthropists – especially those who have made their own fortunes – create foundations that, in turn, contribute to greater and more widespread economic prosperity through knowledge creation. If we do not analyze philanthropy we can understand neither how economic development occurred nor what accounts for US economic dominance.","Capitalism, USA, Entrepreneuralism, Philanthropy","MCB UP Ltd","Published: 2003, Start page: 7"

Earlier research by the authors has demonstrated that the core competence required by founding entrepreneurs is the ability to build and manage relationships. Their more recent work suggests that this core competence must be based around a clear vision for the business. In other words, the founding entrepreneur must be able to build a team to deliver the business vision. A review of literature is provided in this paper, offering a definition of the concept and some of the core issues that have to be addressed by entrepreneurs and small firm policies if businesses are to continue growing. This is supported by some preliminary findings from empirical research into how entrepreneurial teams are formed.

The performance of the SME sector as a whole, and the survival and competitiveness of individual firms, are factors of critical importance in both developed and developing economies. This is recognised by the UK Government, which is adopting measures designed to stimulate the take‐up of services designed for the support of small firms. Thus, the SME sector offers a potentially large and relatively unexploited market for business trainers in which demand depends on the relevance of the supply of training as perceived by owner‐managers. The key to this market is the competence of small business trainers to design and deliver relevant products. This is an important determinant of the choice and quality of the support on offer to owner‐managers. An indicative survey of small business trainers in the UK shows that they themselves recognise a need to enhance their competence in both the design and delivery of products through continued professional development. The way forward for the professional development of trainers is discussed.","General review","Edwin G. Nelson, Yolanda K.

Identifying risks that can be reduced and risks that can be transferred (through insurance) is part of that process. The environment for insurance affects the ability of the high technology‐based entrepreneur to engage in this process. For example, the availability of product liability cover can affect the ability to develop new products. In a combined study of Scottish and West Midlands high technology‐based small firms (HTSFs), follow‐up interviews, cases and research in the insurance industry, we found that this environment is less than perfect. There are issues in the insurance industry that can lead to problems for high technology‐based entrepreneurs. These issues are associated with the availability and search costs associated with specialized insurance. Failure rates of high technology‐based entrepreneurs, although below those of other small firms, are still high. The high cost and limited availability of specialized insurance, which is sought by the high technology entrepreneur, contributes to the difficulty of the environment and adds to the costs and/or risks faced by such entrepreneurs.","General review","David Deakins, Andrew Paddison, Patrick Bentley,  (1997)  ""RISK MANAGEMENT, INSURANCE AND HIGH TECHNOLOGY SMALL FIRMS"", Journal of Small Business and Enterprise Development, Vol. 4 Issue: 1, pp.21-29, https://doi.org/10.1108/eb020977","Published: 1997, Start page: 3"

In this empirical study a resource‐based approach was used as the theoretical background. The research method was purely financial analysis.
Findings – Economies of scale exist in the sector but are limited and do not evolve hand‐in‐hand with company size. There is an optimum size for a timber haulage company at which it can operate efficiently. However, the sector may be polarised.
Research limitations/implications – The data used in the study do not clarify the particular entrepreneurial actions taken in companies as they grew.
Originality/value – This empirical study covers new ground and offers new information about the sector. The results can be used to assist in the development of the sector, which has been studied very little.

By contrast, the owner manager’s belief in the importance of IT to the management of their business is not correlated with performance. Empirical evidence is then presented to confirm that IT use is increasing, in general, year on year, and is being implemented as a management information tool. Finally, a profile is presented of the typical components of a young management information system, within the context of a management accounting framework. It is suggested that, given the proven importance of IT to the new small firm, a management information system should be developed that takes advantage of the opportunities offered by new technology, and that this, in turn, should lead to enhanced performance.","Management information systems, Information technology, Small firms, Company performance","MCB UP Ltd","Published: 1999, Start page: 310"

Despite certain acknowledged benefits, this increasing proceduralisation was held to be detrimental to the informality and flexibility viewed as essential to effective working relationships in the smaller enterprise.

In this study, export intensity, i.e. the percentage exports make towards total turnover, is viewed as a representation of firms' commitment to serving overseas markets.
Design/methodology/approach – The methodology employed a quantitative phase involving a questionnaire completed by 205 Tanzanian SMEs; 112 low intensity (exporting less than 50 per cent of their sales) in comparison with 93 high intensity exporting firms (exporting 50 per cent or more of their sales); also a qualitative phase of interviews with international entrepreneurs in 23 firms.
Findings – The findings provide an initial understanding of the two types of firms' patterns of internationalisation and, more specifically, statistically significant issues are identified in respect of items perceived as affecting their competitiveness in overseas markets, including the extent to which they concentrated on serving key markets rather than diversifying risk over a number of markets.
Practical implications – The results offer insights into the practices of Tanzanian exporting firms and recommendations for policy makers as well as an indication for further research.
Originality/value – This research study explores managerial practices of particular types of firms in Tanzania, which have been largely viewed from a developed as opposed to a developing African country perspective.","Research paper","Published: 2011, Start page: 430"

They have been actively campaigning for a number of years for a tax concession (progressive beer duty or PBD) to alleviate the situation of small brewers. This paper argues that the disadvantages faced by small brewers are due to a complex monopsony in the beer industry, where the power of the distribution segment of the value chain is paramount. It outlines a model of the structure of the UK beer industry, and undertakes two types of empirical analysis to test the potential impact of PBD on the small brewery sector. The paper finds that control over distribution is the key to profitability and survival in the beer industry, and that small brewers with such control are most likely to benefit from PBD.

The normal disclaimers apply. The views expressed in this paper are the author's and do not necessarily reflect those of the Small Business Council, Small Business Service or the UK government.","Purpose – This paper sets out to evaluate critically whether off‐the‐books work in contemporary England is chiefly conducted by employees working for wholly or partially underground businesses, often on low wages and under exploitative conditions.
Design/methodology/approach – Empirical evidence is reported from 861 face‐to‐face interviews in 11 English localities.
Findings – Only a small proportion of off‐the‐books work is conducted by employees working for wholly or partially underground enterprises. The vast majority is conducted either by the self‐employed or by providers of paid favours to friends, acquaintances and kin.
Research limitations/implications – The data reported here are from a household survey based on a maximum variation sample of 11 contrasting localities. Future surveys might use businesses (rather than households) as the unit of analysis and collect a nationally representative sample.
Practical implications – Identifying how off‐the‐books work is predominantly autonomous and self‐employed endeavour, a re‐conceptualisation of this sphere is required as a potential asset rather than hindrance to development, and initiatives developed to legitimise this illegitimate self‐employment rather than simply deter it.
Originality/value – This paper transcends the popular portrayal of off‐the‐books work as conducted by employees under sweatshop conditions and for the first time identifies the proportion undertaken on a self‐employed basis as well as evidence that this sphere is used as a test‐bed by fledgling business ventures which conduct either a proportion or all of their trade in this sphere.","Research paper","Published: 2006, Start page: 7"

Design/methodology/approach – The research design is survey research, statistically t‐testing 12 hypothesized differences between smaller and larger firms in the USA (n=159) and in France (n=116).
Findings – The research finds that both countries' larger firms have significantly (p < 0.05) more non‐family members within top management and make greater use of outside consultants, advisors, and professional services than smaller firms. However, family businesses in France had no other significant differences, while those in the USA had four. Larger US firms have a smaller percentage of women family members working in the firm and less conflict and disagreement between family members; they also spend more time in strategic management activities, and use more sophisticated methods of financing.
Research limitations/implications – There are some variations between the two country samples.
Practical implications – Understanding whether and how family business management activities, styles and characteristics change with growth can help those who own and manage such businesses. It can also be of value to those who advise and assist family businesses, as well as researchers who study them.

Design/methodology/approach – The qualitative approach is based on 18 semi‐directed interviews with managers in Romanian and French exporting SMEs. With an absorptive capacity (AC) perspective, this study investigates export information processing in SMEs as a beginning‐to‐end process, including antecedents, inputs, and outputs.
Findings – The efficiency of export information acquisition and assimilation in SMEs reflects the richness of their international experiences, as well as the richness of export information sources accessed in foreign settings. The transformation and exploitation of export information in SMEs takes various forms: sense‐making, decision making, and development of new export market‐related know‐how and capabilities. The AC framework appears consistent with exporting SME managers' perceptions. The managers' testimonies are generally homogeneous across both countries.
Research limitations/implications – This research offers valuable insights into how SMEs can acquire relevant information and then assimilate, transform, and exploit that information. It neither establishes causality across the different dimensions of AC nor links information processing and exploitation to performance.
Originality/value – This research uses a dynamic AC framework to clarify export information processes.

Currently, however, little research has examined the importance of language barriers relative to other factors which are perceived to inhibit export performance. In addition, previous research has not focused on how these factors differ in respect of SMEs and their larger counterparts. Based on a survey of 939 Welsh manufacturing firms, from which a 22% response rate was obtained, the purpose of this paper is to present some new empirical evidence relating to language barriers, and other perceived inhibitors, to improving the export performance of domestic manufacturing firms located in Wales. A comparative analysis of small, medium and large companies was undertaken and indicates that there are significant differences in perceived export and language barriers which are related to firm size. A further key finding of the study is that a number of export impediments are considered to be significantly more problematic than language barriers. However, 21% of respondents considered that communication barriers currently presented a problematic/very problematic factor inhibiting export performance; with a larger proportion (29%) of respondents indicating that they considered that their future trading performance would improve significantly if language skills were improved within their firms.","General review","Michael J.

This paper uses previously unavailable data to give a broad feel for how borrowing patterns have changed over the period 1987–1995, the type and nature of borrowers using the scheme and the type of loans which they take out.

C. Wilson  (Small Business Research Centre, Kingston Business School, Kingston University, Kingston upon Thames, UK)","The authors are grateful to the Department for Culture, Media and Sport for commissioning the research project on which this paper is based.","Purpose – To distinguish managing creativity from managing innovation and highlight the importance for cultural entrepreneurs of recognising the differences between the two.
Design/methodology/approach – Based on government‐sponsored research project looking at access to finance in the UK music industry. Interviews were carried out with cultural entrepreneurs, finance providers and industry experts. A conceptual model of work and creative production put forward by Leadbeater and Oakley (1999) is used as a foundation for analysis.
Findings – Highlight the importance of recognising the differences between managing creativity and innovation, and call for effective management of them both, through developing business communication skills, external focus and promotional strategies. The different nature and role of collective activities associated with promoting creativity and innovation are highlighted.
Research limitations/implications – The findings are generalised across other “creative industry” businesses, but the empirical research is based only on the music industry.
Practical implications – Practical steps can be taken to increase the success of small creative businesses in managing both the generation of new ideas (creativity) and the successful exploitation of those new ideas (innovation). Formal education courses have an important role in encouraging creativity and flair alongside the acquisition of core business skills necessary for innovation.
Originality/value – This paper makes an important contribution in separating creativity and innovation – concepts that are too often used interchangeably. It is argued that this analytical separation will help practitioners and researchers gain a better understanding of the management behaviours required to foster both successfully.","Conceptual paper","Published: 2005, Start page: 307"

This article seeks to explore the extra dimension of challenge to their already difficult environments when they have to venture into the world‐trade system.
Design/methodology/approach – Recent research undertaken separately by Polish, Italian, Norwegian and UK collaborators examined eight case studies of disparate smaller companies with international operations. This article brings together the common features found, and discusses them in terms of structural drivers and dynamic implications.
Findings – Research findings include the stretching of capabilities in supporting customers in unfamiliar markets, the internal competition for funds in pursuing multiple international markets, the importance of word‐of‐mouth marketing, and the pressures on R&D functions.
Practical implications – The critical importance of balance in smaller enterprises where resources are likely to be tightly constrained is highlighted, and the article observes that, while some of the challenges apply to many firms and other contexts, they are especially critical in SMEs.
Originality/value – This article identifies common pressures and challenges facing SMEs when going global, and uses causal loop diagramming to capture the drivers and consider longer‐term dynamic implications.","Research paper","Published: 2006, Start page: 7"

Design/methodology/approach – An intention‐based approach is used. Longitudinal data concerning 228 nascent entrepreneurs are analysed using hierarchical binary logistic regression.
Findings – The positive effect of professional preparation support on start‐up outcomes is apparent in the results. However, self‐selection effects are detected concerning the use of individual preparation support. The results hold after controlling for these selection effects, intention and other project‐ and individual‐level influences.
Research limitations/implications – The sample size limited the number of variables that could be analysed and the operationalisation used for support could be refined. In addition, the macro‐economic context in which the study took place influenced the results. The results concur with those which consider pre‐start‐up preparation support as a valuable tool to help individuals carry their projects through. In addition, they illustrate the relevance of intention‐based entrepreneurship research and show how this approach can be used to study various factors influencing entrepreneurial processes.
Practical implications – The results show that support actors can contribute to start‐up projects getting launched. They also highlight the presence of self‐selection issues that may be important for support networks to take into consideration when designing their programmes.
Originality/value – To the author's knowledge, this is the first application of an intention‐based approach to study the effect of professional support on a group of nascent entrepreneurs identified so early in their preparation.","Research paper","Published: 2013, Start page: 249"

The data obtained from content analysis suggest that a mix of corporate social responsibility perspectives, help to explain the nature of relationships with, and behaviors toward, various constituency groups. The family character of the business most frequently impacts employee, client, and supplier relationships. Statistically significant interaction effects are reported for the following moderator variables: generation of the owner; company tenure in the community; community size; company size; and inclusion of the family surname in the business name. Interaction effects were also tested for industry type and gender.

The family firms literature recognises that there are differences between family and non‐family businesses; differences that can be explained by conflicts between a juxtaposition of family values and business values. Consequently, family firms tend to have different approaches to ownership and control, the composition of boards, employment practices, strategy formulation and succession management. This paper reports on the demographic characteristics, ownership configurations, boardroom arrangements, managerial and succession practices of a random selection of 1,065 family firms located in Scotland and Northern Ireland. Results reveal that the firms are well‐established, privately owned, small businesses in which the lead family retains almost all shares and dominates the board of directors. These firms give some preferential treatment to family members in employment and managerial matters but business objectives are not ignored. In keeping with previous research, succession matters are not regularly discussed and much more needs to be done to allow for a smooth transition from one family generation to another. The authors conclude by arguing that there is an urgent need for policy makers to address the problems and needs of small family firms and to develop frameworks and practices for assisting these businesses.","Family firms, Policy, Management, Empirical study","MCB UP Ltd","Published: 1999, Start page: 215"

Small, locally based, independent businesses dominated the industry. This industry structure meant that estate agency was seen as a typical entrepreneurial activity. By the first half of the 1990s, however, most estate agencies were in the hands of large institutions in the financial services sector, although recently independent estate agents have begun to reappear on the high street. Nevertheless the dramatic change in the character and structure of estate agency in the UK between the end of the 1970s and the present day raises a number of questions about the nature of entrepreneurship and its impact on industry development. In this paper the development of estate agency in the UK over the past 20 years is analysed, in order to ascertain, first, the relationship between an industry’s fragmentation and the existence of entrepreneurial opportunities within it, and, secondly, the extent to which the radical change in the industry’s structure during that period was the result of the exploitation of an entrepreneurial opportunity.","Estate agents, Entrepreneurialism, Innovation, Financial services, UK","MCB UP Ltd","Published: 1998, Start page: 102"

Design/methodology/approach – A linear regression model was developed that comprised three types of organisations(government, university and R&D institute, agency, financial institution) and three kinds of environmental factors(legal and institutional environment, culture, geographic location) which greatly influence Chinese venture enterprises growth. The model was validated using 91 responses obtained through a questionnaire survey carried out in Shanghai, Zhejiang, Jiangsu and Fujian Province of China.
Findings – Evidence suggests that a fine relationship with a financial organisation positively impacts on the growth of EEs and a close relationship with government shows a disadvantageous impact on the EE's growth. The significant influence of environmental factors appeared to come from entrepreneurial culture and atmosphere.
Practical implications – The findings suggest that Chinese EEs need more favorable financial support. And they also need to have more entrepreneurial learning in a good entrepreneurial culture and atmosphere. Chinese governmental departments should adjust their strategy and means to motivate EEs, not only to give them favourable policy and support but also to improve their competitive power.
Originality/value – The paper highlights the external factors which can significantly affect the growth of Chinese EEs and is, therefore, of practical use for Chinese EEs and support agencies in China. The analysis also offers a more comprehensive understanding about Chinese EEs' development context.","Research paper","Published: 2008, Start page: 640"

On their blog, they wrote in December 2014: “As a Kenyan company based in Nairobi, we know first-hand the challenges of dealing with power cuts. So we built a router that stays online when the lights go out.” BRCK is essentially a self-powered WiFi router designed to deal not only with power cuts but generally to provide internet connectivity in extreme conditions. The device connects to the internet by Ethernet cable, bridging other WiFi signals, or accessing 3G or 4G mobile data connections once a data-activated SIM card is plugged in. The device is power efficient and can be charged by connecting it to anything from a standard power outlet to a solar panel or even a car battery. While it is suited for rough outdoor conditions, solutions like BRCK are becoming essential for young upstarts in Nairobi that are challenged by intermittent electricity and internet breakdowns. Developed countries are not suffering from these problems, yet BRCK can still be used in special situations such as vacation houses in remote areas without internet connection, outdoor/trekking, or at (sporting) events organized outside, which could benefit from a common WiFi connection. As of today, BRCK has the highest number of investors of all companies in our sample.","Entrepreneurship, Venture capital, Frugal innovation, Capability building, Economic development, Foreign investments, Local competences, Low-income countries","Emerald Publishing Limited","Published: 2018, Start page: 346"

Delivery of this objective could contribute to increasing small firm survival rates. A survey of South West SME firms reveals that although owner/managers see benefits in utilising the expertise of their accountants, banks are openly distrusted and there is a preference for minimising contact with the banking community. A parallel survey of accountants and bankers confirmed these attitudes and also indicated that accountants may reinforce the owner/manager behaviour to limit the quantity of financial information which is made available to the bank.

Design/methodology/approach – The paper presents empirical data from face‐to‐face interview‐type research conducted between January 2006 and August 2008 in the regions of Attica and Central Macedonia, Greece. The selection criteria used for the inclusion of enterprises in the ethnic minority business (EMB) database were: ethnicity of the business owner; sectors, including traditional sectors and emerging sectors of EMB; and finally location, i.e. in the regions of Attica and Central Macedonia.
Findings – The findings of this research point to the fact that the three theories of “block mobility”, “opportunity structures” and “ethnic resources” complement each other in explaining the process of starting up an ethnic minority business and becoming self‐employed, while the “cultural thesis” seems to stand on its own.
Originality/value – This paper presents the results of the first‐ever large‐scale authoritative analytical research on EMBs and immigrant entrepreneurship in Greece, provides empirical evidence to why and to what extent ethnic groups are attracted to self‐employment, in which economic sectors they develop occupational niches, and how strong family participation and support is in the EMBs, and attempts to go beyond most of the existing literature, which is focused mainly on “Black” or “Asian” ethnic groups. The research makes a contribution by presenting empirical evidence of five “White”, one “Asian”, one “Indian” and one “Black” ethnic group.","Research paper","Published: 2010, Start page: 8"

Findings – The main results of this empirical research suggest that diversity of educational background offers plausible explanations on the difference of entrepreneurial intentions of Chinese university students. Higher educational institutions should develop more flexible approaches with focus on different groups of students in accordance with their various educational backgrounds.
Practical implications – In response to the change of graduate labour market and the quest for sustainable competitive advantage in China, higher educational institutions have to integrate the change of mindset, skills and abilities about entrepreneurship in their general academic education in order to nurture university students' entrepreneurial intentions in China.

Insightful comments made by Mike Wright on an earlier draft of the article are appreciated. Opinions (and the potential errors) expressed in this paper are, of course, those of the authors alone.","Purpose – This exploratory study aims to provide fresh insights into the ownership transfer of private family firms through internal management buy‐out (MBO) and external management buy‐in (MBI) succession routes. The paper aims to explore if flows of information impact the succession planning process and if the nature of succession planning impacts the business sale negotiation process relating to family firms that select MBO/MBI succession routes.
Design/methodology/approach – Guided by insights from agency theory and theories relating to information asymmetries and negotiation behaviour six hypotheses were derived. Private family firms that had received venture capital and the MBO/I deals had been completed between 1994 and 2003 were identified. A structured survey was administered to 117 senior members of acquiring MBO/I management teams after the deal had been completed in several European countries. Non‐parametric chi‐square tests and Mann‐Whitney “U” tests were used to test the presented hypotheses.
Findings – Evidence highlights the importance of information sharing and that the family owner(s) may not always be in the strongest position. MBOs reported lower information asymmetry. Also, lower information asymmetry was reported when vendors and management were involved in succession planning. Internal managers with greater access to information were found to influence the negotiation process and determine who is more likely to benefit from the price to be paid for the firm. A mutually agreed price was less likely when management controlled information and when personal equity providers (PEP) were involved in the process supporting the interests of the MBO/I team.
Practical implications – Family firm owners need to plan for succession planning. Vendors of family firms need to leverage external professional advice when negotiating the sale of their ventures to ensure “family agendas” are protected.
Originality/value – This study has extended the conceptual work of Howorth et al. surrounding the succession of family firms through MBOs and MBIs. Rather than relying on case study evidence alone, cross‐sectional survey evidence was explored within a univariate statistical framework to explore gaps in the knowledge base relating to succession planning and business sale negotiation behaviour.","Research paper","Published: 2008, Start page: 8"

The Research Assessment Exercise (RAE) has brought the whole area of research publication and dissemination into sharp relief, and striving for high research rankings seems, for some, to have become an end in itself. Some argue that the RAE has restricted the wider dissemination of research as academics focus on refereed journal articles to the detriment of other forms of output, eg professional articles, consultancy, books and practitioner conferences. The RAE has intensified interest in the purpose and process of publication in most discipline areas and has created considerable controversy regarding the status of different publication channels. The small business research area is no exception. This research provides a profile of the UK small business research community, it explores their perceptions regarding research and establishes the esteem that various publication channels are held. Defining precisely what constitutes the area of small business research is problematic. Indeed, providing a specific boundary would create a false precision, small business research overlaps with areas such as entrepreneurship and innovation, and it also draws upon a range of disciplines. Nevertheless, relative limits were placed on this research by the nature of the people who were asked to express their opinion and the questions they were asked. The attitudes were sought through a survey of active UK researchers (97 per cent of respondents had published in the area, 81 per cent were academics, 7 per cent were policy makers and 4 per cent business practitioners) listed on the Institute of Small Business Affairs/Small Business Research Trust database. The title and nature of these organisations suggests that those listed at least identify with the notion of small business research as an area. In addition, the questionnaire emphasised small business research throughout, and no mention was made of entrepreneurship, innovation or associated areas. Ninety‐eight questionnaires were returned, representing a 47 per cent response rate. The community was found to be more stable and mature than expected, but small business researchers held other research areas in greater esteem and most regarded themselves as empiricists rather than theorists. The implications of these results are explored for the next RAE and for the future of small business research.","Research, Dissemination, Publishing, Rating","MCB UP Ltd","Published: 2001, Start page: 5"

To overcome the frequent absence of a large firm‐type hub in the SME sector, the Institute evolved a five‐phase model in which an independent individual external to the potential network assumes the role of broker and is responsible for guiding an inter‐firm co‐operation process. Observation of a pilot initiative in the UK determined that the most critical event within the process model is the identification of a viable idea which can provide the basis for forming a new business network. A study to gain further understanding of the nature of any process gap within the methodology, which brokers have been advised to utilize, indicated that the technique of unstructured, open‐ended interviewing to gain an understanding of factors influencing the performance of firms is often not very effective. Details are provided here of a new, more structured audit tool. A preliminary qualitative evaluation of the new technique indicated this has significant potential for assisting the broker to rapidly identify a viable idea which can provide the basis for forming a new business network.","General review","Ian Chaston,  (1995)  ""SMALL BUSINESS NETWORKS: ASSISTING THE IDEA IDENTIFICATION PROCESS"", Journal of Small Business and Enterprise Development, Vol. 2 Issue: 3, pp.133-141, https://doi.org/10.1108/eb020955","Published: 1995, Start page: 133"

Design/methodology/approach – A literature review of internationalization of small firms is carried out. It is concluded that understanding of managerial behavior in small international firms is in need of improvement. Therefore, the literature on managerial behavior is described, scrutinized and deployed in the context of small firms' internationalization.
Findings – No previous research has combined the research on small‐business internationalization and managerial behavior. Hypotheses that can be empirically tested and new research questions that can yield a better understanding of the internationalization processes in small firms are developed.
Research limitations/implications – The hypotheses developed in this study have not yet been tested empirically. Further research is suggested to confirm and elaborate these propositions.
Practical implications – As the propositions in this study are not tested their practical implications are limited at present. However, earlier research has shown that there is a link between managerial behavior and firm behavior. Managers may be inspired by the study to reflect upon this link and adjust their behavior in ways that can improve their firms' international development.
Originality/value – In this paper the research on internationalization in small firms is merged with the research on managerial behavior. By adding knowledge from the latter research tradition, the understanding of small‐firm internationalization should be advanced through raising novel issues and applying new methodological tools.","Conceptual paper","Published: 2008, Start page: 8"

However, different types of firm place a greater emphasis upon different strategic positions.

They also want to acknowledge the financial support from the Foundation for Economic Education for conducting this study.","Purpose – The aim of this study is to discuss how social capital is developed in the internationalization process of small and medium‐sized family enterprises (family SMEs).
Design/methodology/approach – This paper reports findings from an in‐depth multiple case study with four Finnish manufacturing family SMEs. The data were analyzed through the perspectives of structural holes, network closure, and the interplay between these two mechanisms.
Findings – The material in the paper demonstrated that family entrepreneurs had a large number of structural holes when launching international operations, but also after several years of running international operations. Instead of trying to span structural holes, they concentrated merely on developing the network closure with agents and subsidiary staff. The case firms spent a lot of resources on finding suitable network ties and on developing good network closure with the selected social capital ties.
Research limitations/implications – There are some aspects that might differ depending on the home and target country of firms. For instance, firms in some Asian countries are able to utilize emigrant relationships that help them with networking, which was not the case here with Finnish family SMEs.
Practical implications – Family entrepreneurs seem to have a tendency to concentrate on a limited number of foreign partners, and to neglect the building of new relationships that could help them in future challenges.
Originality/value – This study: responds to calls for more research on network development in the entrepreneurial process, especially in the context of internationalization; introduces the notions of network closure and structural holes to the internationalization context; and reveals how social capital restricts and facilitates family SMEs' international operations.","Research paper","Published: 2012, Start page: 7"

Findings – High scores on a creativity test and prior entrepreneurial experiences are positively associated with entrepreneurial intentions, whereas perception of risks has a negative influence.

It first raises some fundamental questions which arise when case material is used in management research. For example, confusion surrounds the distinctions between qualitative data, inductive logic and case study research. Further, the processes of building theory from case studies lacks clarity. To help clear up some of these matters several research programmes are described in which the author has been personally involved and which developed theory from case studies. These case studies are used as illustrations of the multiple ways that case material might be used. Although every researcher has his/her preferred approach, it is concluded that case studies may be built up in a number of ways from, on the one hand, deep single case studies to multiple case studies using comparative logic, on the other. Between these two extremes are a number of hybrid methods which use both approaches.","General review","John Gill,  (1995)  ""BUILDING THEORY FROM CASE STUDIES"", Journal of Small Business and Enterprise Development, Vol. 2 Issue: 2, pp.71-75, https://doi.org/10.1108/eb020950","Published: 1995, Start page: 71"

It is encouraging to find agreement between policy makers and academics that SMEs have an important role in generating new jobs and that a European policy is needed to provide coordination between member states while encouraging devolved responsibility through local tailored initiatives. The challenge that practitioners, policy makers and academics now face is finding the best way to help SMEs and the unemployed.

The study had two aims: to investigate the benefits available from the use of Web 2.0 in small business collaborations, and to characterize the different types of such online collaborations.
Design/methodology/approach – The research uses a qualitative case study methodology based on semi‐structured interviews with the owner‐managers of 12 UK‐based small companies in the business services sector who are early adopters of Web 2.0 technologies.
Findings – Benefits from the use of Web 2.0 are categorized as lifestyle benefits, internal operational efficiency, enhanced capability, external communications and enhanced service offerings. A 2×2 framework is developed to categorize small business collaborations using the dimensions of the basis for inter‐organizational collaboration (control vs cooperation) and the level of Web 2.0 ICT use (simple vs sophisticated).
Research limitations/implications – A small number of firms of similar size, sector and location were studied, which limits generalizability. Nonetheless, the results offer a pointer to the likely future use of Web 2.0 tools by other small businesses.
Practical implications – The research provides evidence of the attraction and potential of Web 2.0 for collaborations between small businesses.
Originality/value – The paper is one of the first to report on use of Web 2.0 ICT in collaborative working between small businesses.

The present research uses primary data obtained by means of a questionnaire, involving a sample of students, which were currently engaged in a graduation course at the University of Beira Interior. The questionnaire was administrated by interviews conducted in the classrooms of the University's faculties. The collected data were submitted to a multivariate statistical analysis.
Findings – Research findings include the existence of a typology of two distinct groups of students, respectively designated by “The accommodated independents” and “The confidents”, according to the most outstanding characteristics related with several attributes and motivations presented by each of them.
Practical implications – The identification of the entrepreneurs' characteristics and the knowledge of the potential business creator students' profile may be important for the development of an adequate educational programme directed to the entrepreneurship education and start‐up processes.

Design/methodology/approach – Based on the competency approach of understanding entrepreneurial learning, a qualitative study was conducted on a sample of 12 successful entrepreneurs. The data were collected using semi‐structured interviews based on the critical incident approach. A two‐stage approach was adopted in the data analysis.
Findings – Six patterns of entrepreneurial learning behaviours emerged from the analysis, and they were exerted in three transformative processes, namely accumulating experience through carrying out entrepreneurial tasks, consolidating learning outcomes from experience, and applying or transferring one's own and others' learning outcomes when carrying out the tasks. Also, the processes were under the influence of the learning contexts and the learning behaviours were reinforced throughout the process. Based on the analysis, a model of entrepreneurial learning centred upon the learning behaviours was constructed empirically.
Research limitations/implications – Entrepreneurial learning can be seen as an open, generative, iterative and self‐reinforcing process. Further investigation can be conducted on the intensity of entrepreneurial learning, its effectiveness, and its relationships with entrepreneurs' tasks, experience, learning outcomes, and learning contexts.
Practical implications – Education and training for entrepreneurs should be situated within the actual workplace or simulated contexts that provide them with opportunities to apply what they have learned while taking action, to accumulate their first‐hand experience and to reflect upon experience.
Originality/value – Entrepreneurial learning is considered and examined as an observable and measurable construct with a focus on the learning behaviours exhibited by entrepreneurs.","Research paper","Published: 2012, Start page: 380"

However, increasingly the distinction between public and private sectors is irrelevant, with the emergence of a new option for clients: agencies that are publicly funded but which deliver their services using a model that has been drawn from the private sector. This has implications for the clients of such services, as well as the service providers themselves. In a number of countries where the “private sector” model is being adopted for the delivery of “public good” services, the agencies involved in designing the policies and delivering the programmes are facing considerable challenges in moving from one model to the other.","Small‐ to medium‐sized enterprises, Private sector, Public sector, Technology transfer, Policy","MCB UP Ltd","Published: 2003, Start page: 128"

Can a new engineering school aimed at fostering entrepreneurship reverse this trend? The purpose of this paper is to compare the development of engineering students' entrepreneurial intentions and perceived career orientation of the prestigious engineering training schools (Ecole Centrale de Lille) and ITEEM, whose curriculum is dual (engineering+management), new and based on active pedagogies.
Design/methodology/approach – This study is based on qualitative analysis of 12 in‐depth interviews and quantitative longitudinal analysis of data obtained from a questionnaire administered each year to all students from both schools.
Findings – Results show that ITEEM fosters students' entrepreneurial and project management careers, whereas Centrale promotes the traditional technical model of an engineer. Family background of students is close in both schools. Level of entrepreneurial intention at enrolling is higher at ITEEM than Centrale but cannot fully explain why entrepreneurial career orientations decrease at Centrale while they increase at ITEEM. On the other hand, perception of school culture is weak at Centrale and strong at ITEEM and this difference is significantly with regard to the development of students' career orientation. Qualitative interviews indicate that both cultures highlight different elements.
Research limitations/implications – The cultural element can then be proposed as a new factor to take into account when studying the impact of entrepreneurship education. However, this result is based here on a simple measure of school culture perception and qualitative interviews. It should be confirmed by a more detailed quantitative analysis of cultural and organizational characteristics of educational institutions.
Practical implications – Engineering schools can foster entrepreneurial orientations if their educational culture is perceived as new and innovative by students. This can be achieved through a new curriculum based on a wider set of courses (management, entrepreneurship and engineering) and the systematic deployment of active pedagogies such as project work and internships. A new question arises: can such a perception of innovation be maintained over time?
Originality/value – In the theoretical literature, culture is considered to be an essential element that can have an impact on entrepreneurial career aspirations and intentions. But as yet, no empirically based study had been carried out to prove it.","Research paper","Published: 2011, Start page: 194"

Design/methodology/approach – The study employed an electronic survey of 500 PhD students across six faculties, and 128 useable responses were returned. Students were asked to rate the importance of a range of enterprise skills and attributes derived from the literature, plus the extent to which these skills and attributes had been developed through their programme of study.
Findings – The majority of PhD students recognise the importance of enterprise skills and attributes, particularly those associated with communication, confidence, achieving outcomes, determination and problem solving. Whilst some enterprise skills and attributes are developed well through PhD study, others – such as managing finance and people – are not. A number of these are skills that might be particularly relevant to early‐career PhD graduates.
Research limitations/implications – The research is limited to one case institution, and further research is required to investigate how the training and development gaps identified might be best addressed.
Originality/value – The study examines enterprise education within the novel context of postgraduate research studies. It identifies a need to re‐examine our approach to the training and development of PhD students in order to address their evolving career needs.","Research paper","Published: 2012, Start page: 380"

Businesses should, therefore, consider whether the Internet could provide them with a new marketing opportunity. Although increasing numbers of businesses now have a website, there seems to be a quality problem that is leading to missed opportunities, particularly for smaller enterprises. This belief is backed up by an automated survey of 3,802 predominantly small UK business sites, believed to be by far the largest of its kind to date. Analysis of the results reveals widespread problems in relation to search engines. Most Internet users find new sites through search engines, yet over half of the sites checked were not registered in the largest one, Yahoo!, and could therefore be missing a sizeable percentage of potential customers. The underlying problem with business sites is the lack of maturity of the medium as evidenced by the focus on technological issues amongst designers and the inevitable lack of Web‐business experience of managers. Designers need to take seriously the usability of the site, its design and its ability to meet the business goals of the client. These issues are perhaps being taken up less than in the related discipline of software engineering, probably owing to the relative ease of website creation. Managers need to dictate the objectives of their site, but also, in the current climate, cannot rely even on professional website design companies and must be capable of evaluating the quality of their site themselves. Finally, educators need to ensure that these issues are emphasised to the next generation of designers and managers in order that the full potential of the Internet for business can be realised.","Internet, World Wide Web, Small‐ to medium‐sized enterprises, Design","MCB UP Ltd","Published: 2000, Start page: 105"

Design/methodology/approach – The research methodology was survey research collecting data from seven countries. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was run to test for differences in family business succession planning between countries, controlling for years in business, number of employees, industry, and type of ownership. ANCOVA was followed by a post hoc pairwise comparisons least significant difference (LSD) to determine which countries did have significant differences in their extent of succession planning.
Findings – The paper finds that there were statistically significant differences in family business succession planning between Croatia, Egypt, France, Kosovo, Kuwait, and the USA. However, there were no statistically significant differences between India and the other six countries.
Research limitations/implications – There is a growing body of literature focusing on family business succession, as researchers attempt to better understand the problems of passage that can exist in family firms. Thus, an important research question is: why are some family businesses able to successfully manage succession while others are not? Further research is needed to answer this question.

The study demonstrates a framework and example for interpreting entrepreneurial learning and developing practical theory from these accounts. Thirty practising entrepreneurs were interviewed, in a wide range of industries and at different stages of life and career experience, from first venture to experienced serial entrepreneur. Practical theories of entrepreneurial working have been developed, using the framework of “what, how, why, who and in what conditions” the practices identified are effective. The practical theories arising from the study are presented using this structured framework, based on a sense making perspective.

The minority of IR studies that are focused on smaller firms tend to be prescriptive and their results polarise into either the “small is beautiful” or the “bleak house” perspective and involve relatively small target samples. As a result, there is a paucity of quantitative research that could be generalised across this important sector of the British economy. The research (1998‐2000) on which this article is based originated from a perceived need to redress this imbalance. Quantitative and qualitative data were collected from a target sample of 6,000 organisations. Preliminary results indicate that the majority of small business owner/managers in the sample exhibited personalised and mostly informal management styles. It emerges that IR in this type of business can be as varied as the characteristics, personalities and preferences exhibited by the respondents in the research sample.","Industrial relations, Entrepreneurs, Management styles, United Kingdom, Small‐ to medium‐sized enterprises","MCB UP Ltd","Published: 2002, Start page: 236"

The introduction of the TECs in 1989 encompassed a number of features of the UK Government's SME policy. The TECs have been given wide‐ranging and challenging responsibilities. Whilst there is no clear demarcation line between the TECs' enterprise and training activities, this paper is more concerned with their role in promoting ‘enterprise’ in SMEs. A broad brush survey of TECs conducted for this paper reveals that the different TECs have adopted different approaches to fulfilling this role. The paper then describes an initiative offered by one particular TEC; the scheme in question enables SMEs to finance the use of consultants to assist in business planning and management development activities. The operation of this scheme encapsulates many of the key issues involved in SME policy, such as how to select companies for assistance and how to design an integrated programme of SME support. Finally, the implications of these findings for the future of the TECs are explored, with the caveat that the role of the TECs will inevitably mirror the (constantly evolving) government policy towards SMEs.","General review","Grahame Boocock, David Lauder, John Presley,  (1994)  ""THE ROLE OF THE TECs IN SUPPORTING SMEs IN ENGLAND"", Journal of Small Business and Enterprise Development, Vol. 1 Issue: 1, pp.12-18, https://doi.org/10.1108/eb020928","Published: 1994, Start page: 3"

This paper aims to examine the interplay of work relations and “growth” in the particular case of WhitCo (an organisation that was attempting the transition from its entrepreneurial beginnings to a more formally configured set‐up). The study, which is based on an ethnographic investigation in the case firm over a year‐long period, addresses three issues: the motivations for growth in the small professional service firm; the manner in which attempts at organisational transition impinge upon “collegial” patterns of work relations typical in these firms; and the importance of interpersonal relations to “growth”. The study provides a rare insight into the management of social relations within a firm typical of many in the business services sector. It highlights the critical role of “people management” to shaping the trajectory of small firm growth.","Small firms, Professional service firms, Growth, Strategy, Conflict","MCB UP Ltd","Published: 2000, Start page: 7"

Regression models have been developed to analyze the causal relationship between three dimensions of competitiveness (competitive advantage over competitors, customer satisfaction and employees’ motivation), and environmental practices that can be adopted by HORECA SMEs.FindingsTop management commitment emerges as a key driver of competitiveness, confirming the strategic relevance of a sound approach to sustainability also in SMEs operating in the tourism sector. Moreover, actions aimed at investing in green food products (e.g. organic food) and awareness campaigns emerge as strong predictors of good business performance. Finally, at managerial level, entrepreneurs and owners evaluate the implementation of internal sustainability monitoring systems as a relevant support to increase their competitive performance.Research limitations/implicationsSince the results are limited to Italian HORECA businesses, a cross-country comparison could represent a potential improvement of the research. Moreover, since the sector is characterized by the predominance of small and micro firms, specific attention should be devoted to the role played by entrepreneurs’ personal values in shaping business strategies.Originality/valueThe paper contributes to the ongoing debate on the relationship between SMEs in the tourism sector and the environmental dimension analyzing the link between the adoption of “green” practices and the competitive performance.

Questions were asked about relationships with stakeholders and the impacts of support mechanisms for the organisation in practice. Barriers to growth and development were identified and a model of the most important strategic issues was proposed which NTBFs could relate to. Key policy issues which the NTBFs consider important for their strategic growth included innovation, internationalisation, human resources and collaboration.

It seeks to compare the factors of how new firms achieve a high rate of growth during the first four years and years five to eight.
Design/methodology/approach – The study reported here is part of a longitudinal research project that has followed the development of 200 SMEs in Finnish metal‐based manufacturing and business services since their start‐up in 1990. At the seven‐year follow‐up the present study concentrates on the 86 surviving firms. Logistic regression analysis was used as statistical technique in locating differences between high‐growth and other firms and their owner‐managers in the selected attributes. This paper focuses on Storey's key elements. In search of potential differences in these characteristics between high‐growth firms and other firms, this study compares Finnish firms in relation to founders' motives in starting up on their own account and in their individual background characteristics, changes in strategic factors, changes in networks and management styles during various stages of entrepreneurship.
Findings – The results indicated firstly that there is a clear connection between entrepreneur's know‐how and the high growth of firms. Secondly, the findings of this study demonstrate that external networks as a management capability bring about great competitive advantage, innovations and efficiency, especially during the first four years. However, the findings of five to eight years of development contradict the findings of the first four years. The results show that the use of internal networks has a positive effect on firms' high growth during years five to eight years. Finally, the results show that industry sector affected high growth, especially in specialised metal industry firms, both during the first four years and after five to eight years of development.
Research limitations/implications – The implications of this study for academics, educational institutions, entrepreneurs, and other practitioners are that the so‐called support services of internationalisation and growth for new firms are most important. These support services could be developed with public sector assistance in areas such as financing research, innovation and information technology projects.
Orginiality/value – The paper provides a framework for testing the factors that differentiate growing new ventures during various stages of entrepreneurship.","Research paper","Published: 2010, Start page: 8"

Correia  (Auxiliary Professor of Microeconomics
and Industrial Economics at the University of Minho, Braga, Portugal)","The objective of this paper is to assess the potential of Portuguese manufacturing firms with respect to two fundamental issues that have been at the core of important debates about comparative advantages of small firms and large ones: (1) Employment: Using a database compiled between 1982 and 1992, we analyse the contribution of small firms to job creation. This analysis aims to consider the different aspects of firm mobility: Entry, expansion, contraction and exit. The results indicate that, in the period considered, only small firms created employment and that this creation is mainly associated with the expansion of young firms located in the Littoral North and Centre regions of Portugal. Nevertheless, when we consider only small firms that are incumbents in all the period, results indicate that job creation is a feature specific to a small number of fast‐growing small firms. The effects of the economic cycle were tested too, and it was found that employment creation by small firms is less sensitive to economic fluctuations, as reductions in employment in small firms do not seem to grow in crisis periods. (2) Technical efficiency: Independently from the job creation potential, it is important to evaluate whether small firms use economic resources in an efficient manner. To assess the efficiency of small businesses relative to large ones, we use plant‐level information, thereby specifying and estimating a translog production model. This model allows estimating and comparing returns of scale and substituting elasticities for both small and large production units, covering a large number of six‐digit sectors for the year 1995. Preliminary results suggest that: (I) There are significant differences in the production technology between large and small establishments; (ii) small establishments do not appear to be more flexible than large ones in factor substitution; (iii) large size is not a condition for efficiency in production. Therefore, considering the importance and weight small firms have upon the manufacturing industry employment volume, and the lack of any evidence regarding technical inefficiencies in the production, we may infer that small firms justify the public powers’ attention, while designing and implementing policies which would support their survival as well as their growth. Such policies should enhance and refine their labour (and management) qualification techniques as well as design better strategies for disseminating information and new technologies. In fact, these policies would most certainly promote the development of Portuguese small firms, turning them into more innovating, flexible and competitive ones, even in those industries which traditionally comprise large firms.","Small firms, Employment, Portugal, Efficiency, Manufacturing","MCB UP Ltd","Published: 2001, Start page: 301"

The paper seeks to shed light on the types of tacit knowledge related to achieving sales within the first year of new technology ventures.
Design/methodology/approach – A survey was administered to 145 technology venture founders during structured interviews across 13 university‐affiliated technology incubators. To investigate tacit knowledge a framework was used comprised of ways to serve markets, customer problems, markets, and technology. The results were analyzed using t‐tests and logistic regression while controlling for founder's years of work experience. A configuration analysis is presented revealing the patterns of knowledge related to sales in the first year of new ventures.
Findings – The study provides an understanding of how types of tacit knowledge relate to early sales outcomes in the high technology context. Prior hands‐on experiences with development of products or services as well as prior experiences within markets were found vital to achieving first‐year sales for newly created innovations. On the other hand, tacit knowledge of customer problems and technology is, surprisingly, of less importance.
Research limitations/implications – The findings provide insights as to the particular hands on experiences important in achieving desirable venture outcomes. By identifying and developing tacit knowledge in particular areas (prior hands‐on development experience and prior experience within markets) future entrepreneurs may develop an early sales advantage. The results demonstrate how configurations of tacit knowledge link to desired outcomes while highlighting the importance of certain knowledge at the opportunity recognition stage of new product development.
Practical implications – Generation of early sales for new technology ventures is a momentous concern for enterprise development. The ability to identify specific types of knowledge that link to initial sales enables educators and entrepreneurs alike.
Originality/value – The paper develops further a theoretical conceptualization of types of knowledge related to recognizing opportunities. The study contributes to the literature by assessing how patterns of tacit knowledge at opportunity recognition relate to achieving early sales in the context of technology entrepreneurship.","Research paper","Published: 2010, Start page: 8"

Using the GBPS, the identification of training needs is directly related to the activities of the business. This approach overcomes the problem, inherent in SMEs and owner‐managed businesses, of a reluctance to endorse training because it is not clearly relevant to entrepreneurial business operations.

At the global level, technological developments and competitive conditions have been seen as ‘increasing pressure on firms to co‐operate along and between value‐added chains’ (Dunning, 1993). However, does this apply only to multinational enterprises competing in world markets? In the early 1990s many small firms in London were also under pressure; they were often in industries characterized by significant technical changes, to which managers had responded by introducing technical developments into their own firms. They had often been severely constrained in their attempts to achieve their business objectives by difficult competitive conditions, notably the poor growth of market demand and the increasing intensity of competition. Of course, businesses everywhere have always faced changes in their competitive environments and it is the responsibility of management to make appropriate responses to these changes. However, firms vary in their ability to identify and understand the competitive environment and in their ability to mobilize and manage the resources needed for a successful response (Pettigrew and Whipp, 1993).","General review","Paul Joyce, Adrian Woods, Sharon Black,  (1995)  ""NETWORKS AND PARTNERSHIPS: MANAGING CHANGE AND COMPETITION"", Journal of Small Business and Enterprise Development, Vol. 2 Issue: 1, pp.11-18, https://doi.org/10.1108/eb020945","Published: 1995, Start page: 3"

Research limitations – Larger studies are needed to corroborate the findings of this initial study, particularly in some regional categories. The open‐ended question format required some subjective interpretation by the researchers; future surveys utilizing an objective answer format would be recommended.
Practical implications – The amount of consensus indicates that if entrepreneurs, academics, and others collaborated and pooled their knowledge and resources, some of the critical barriers to success could be overcome. The field could benefit by future research focusing on identifying specific collaboration strategies among regions or countries leading to the growth of entrepreneurial ventures and economic development.
Originality/value – Surveying experts regarding the facilitators and impediments to entrepreneurship (both regionally and globally) will help to bridge the gulf between theory and practical solutions to drive economic development.","Research paper","Published: 2012, Start page: 380"

Design/methodology/approach – The authors employ a longitudinal postal survey approach, involving a sample of undergraduates who responded in 1994 and in 1997.
Findings – Evidence suggests that the STEP has enhanced the skills, expertise and credibility of graduates seeking employment in SMEs. Prospective employers consider the skills and experience gained by STEP graduates as an advantage.
Research limitations/implications – The longitudinal data under investigation is relatively old, but not obsolete. A further investigation of the impact that the STEP had on the research sample is planned for the near future.
Practical implications – The result suggests that owners/managers of SMEs are increasingly seeking specific business‐related skills. Higher education institutes should proactively liaise with their local business communities to ensure that students gain a broad range of skills, as required by employers in this important and expanding sector of the British economy.

Comments and suggestions from referees have been very helpful. The authors thank Dr Jun Li and Dr Jiayong Gao for their valuable comments and editorial help.","Purpose – This study aims to compare rapid‐growth companies with slow‐growth ones in order to provide fresh insights into the attributes of Chinese rapid‐growth companies through an integrated research framework, which was adapted from the framework proposed by Wiklund and by Barringer.
Design/methodology/approach – To obtain data for analysis, the research selected the top 30 rapid‐growth firms and the bottom 30 slow‐growth firms from a data bank which contains complete financial data of 533 firms from 2001 to 2003. All data concerning rapid‐growth were coded either one or zero, and were analyzed by Fisher's Exact Test to find out the frequency of important growth variables.
Findings – It is found that the major differences between rapid‐growth and slow‐growth firms lie in different favorite firm resources and capacities, task environment, and entrepreneurial strategies. They can create greater value for success with certain entrepreneurs, and might spur those entrepreneurs to push their firms onto a rapid growth road. In addition, the variable of creating unique value emerges as a strong predictor of rapid growth. Entrepreneur orientation strategy is not found to be significantly facilitating rapid growth. This illustrates that all growth companies value highly entrepreneurship‐oriented strategy.
Practical implications – These research findings confirm that growth is not a random event and that entrepreneurs are not necessarily natural. These research findings will promote entrepreneurship education and entrepreneurship in China.
Originality/value – There are two originalities in this research. First, the authors developed a new integrated framework based on previous research achievements. Second, it is the first empirical study concerning company growth variables in China.","Research paper","Published: 2008, Start page: 640"

Data were collected through an online survey.FindingsTeam conscientiousness level and team openness to experience diversity were found to interact with shared leadership to influence team effectiveness in a supplementary way, such that the relationship between shared leadership and team effectiveness will be stronger when the team’s mean score on conscientiousness level is high and diversity score on openness to experience is low. Another finding from this study is that team diversity scores on emotional stability and agreeableness interact with shared leadership in a complementary way; that is, the higher the diversity score, the better influence shared leadership has on team effectiveness.Practical implicationsFirst, this study provides policy implications for government agencies, foundations, and universities who provide support for start-ups in incubators. These institutions should know the importance of entrepreneurial team composition and team process to start-up performance and should provide entrepreneurial teams support in team development. Second, the study provides entrepreneurs with implications regarding team member selection.Originality/valueThis is one of the first papers to study the interaction between personality composition and shared leadership and its impact on new venture performance.

The Small Business Service’s consultation paper, “Integrating the business support infrastructure for SMEs”, advocated “customer‐driven, not supply‐led” publicly funded business support, where personal business advisers (PBA) signpost the company to advice. Advisers must assess their client’s needs using their business experience, which results in the advisers developing heuristics (or “rules‐of‐thumb”) to understand the essential components of the flourishing firm. The paper contends that an inductive methodology can uncover advisers’ heuristics, developed to derive a practical “model” of success. In total, 29 business advisers participated in individual semi‐structured interviews and a focus group of ten public sector business advisers provided a qualitative element of the research. The model borrows concepts from systems theory to conceptually represent how practical business advisers view the world of the small firm manager. This suggests that there is a tension between the focus of business advisers on a “closed” system of management, whereas owner‐managers concentrate on a more concrete open system of sales, cash and production.","Systems theory, Complexity theory, Business support services, Advisory services, Small to medium‐sized enterprises","Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Published: 2004, Start page: 8"

We adopt a comparative case study methodology to develop an evolutionary process view of financial management in small firms. Despite the increased attention paid to owner‐managers in the small firms sector, we know comparatively little about the process of financial management and how small firms learn and adjust strategy and decision‐making in this area. In this paper, we attempt to shed some light on the process issues within small firms from qualitative evidence collected as part of a programme of case study research with entrepreneurs and owner‐managers.

Earlier versions of this paper have been read at the RENT conference (Copenhagen, 24‐26 November 2004), and at the ICSB Pre‐Conference “Global perspectives on entrepreneurship policy” (Washington DC, 15 June 2005).","Purpose – Administrative burdens are known to be a major business constraint for incumbent small to medium‐sized enterprises (SMEs) in modern economies. Far less is known about the influence of these burdens on the start‐up of new firms. The current paper aims to examine to what extent perceived administrative complexity related to starting a new business influences the number of business owners across 18 OECD countries.
Design/methodology/approach – The article combines data on business ownership from EIM's COMPENDIA database and data on perceived administrative complexity from the Eurobarometer public opinion surveys coordinated by the European Commission. This regression model enables one to explicitly control for the influence of unemployment on the level of business ownership (“refugee effect”). There is also control for risk tolerance and access to finance.
Findings – The results suggest that administrative complexity is negatively related to business ownership. When administrative procedures related to business start‐up are complex, potential entrepreneurs are discouraged from starting a new firm.
Research limitations/implications – Owing to data constraints, the temporal specification of the independent variables is not ideal. Therefore the findings in this paper should be regarded as exploratory.
Practical implications – The results suggest that it is important not only to reduce administrative burdens in order to increase the number of new firms, but also for governments to communicate existing administrative regulations to a country's population.
Originality/value – This is one of the first attempts to empirically link business ownership and perceived administrative complexity related to starting a new business for a large number of countries.","Research paper","Published: 2006, Start page: 7"

This paper seeks to examine the inhibitors and enablers that small and medium‐sized enterprises (SMEs) face when promoting health within their workplaces. Previous research within workplace health promotion has largely focused on large, often multi‐national organisations.
Design/methodology/approach – A descriptive qualitative approach was adopted which involved interviewing health‐promotion champions/co‐ordinators within five SMEs located in south Wales in the UK. A thematic content analysis was undertaken and key themes identified.
Findings – The results identify key enablers to participating in health‐promotion programmes as being an external facilitator and the appointment of an internal health champion/co‐ordinator. The main inhibitors were resources, time and the longevity of the external support funded by a government initiative.
Practical implications – The paper identifies the enablers and barriers to SMEs promoting workplace health. An adaptation of a framework is provided to assist SME owner/managers to promote workplace health.
Originality/value – Few studies have examined the workplace health promoting activities of SMEs and particularly the role of externally supported programmes. This paper fills some of the gaps.","Research paper","Published: 2012, Start page: 575"

A network perspective is presented in order to evaluate the ways in which  workplace relations are enacted to cultural organising. A social constructionist perspective of organisational networking is proposed which emphasises how individuals attribute value and meaning to the interactions they have with co‐workers in the workplace. A work place ethnography is presented which discusses the recruitment of a “professional” manager and his attempts to introduce new working practices into the family business. The analysis highlights how organisational members shape cultural organising by invoking emotional categories to produce mutuality and a sense of belonging in the workplace. In continually re‐enacting workplace relationships in this way, it is found that individuals attempt to trade away variance, divergent views and new organising practices concerned with change. The paper concludes with a final analysis of the ethnography and its implication for small business research and training.","Networking, National cultures, Strategy, Ethnography, Small firms","MCB UP Ltd","Published: 2002, Start page: 331"

The support provided by the Medici Fellowship Scheme management group is also warmly acknowledged. Opinions (and the potential errors) expressed in this paper are, of course, the authors’ alone.","Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to explore whether the Medici Fellowship Scheme addressed attitudinal and resource barriers to the commercialisation of knowledge within five research‐intensive universities. The following research questions were explored: Did the Medici fellows change the attitudes of academic network members in host departments towards the commercialisation of research? Did the Medici Fellowship Scheme encourage fellows to accumulate human and social capital? Did the Medici Fellowship Scheme encourage fellows to leverage their academic and practitioner networks?
Design/methodology/approach – The scheme was implemented in Biomedical departments across five universities located in the Midlands in England. Six months after the completion of the scheme information was consistently gathered from six Medici fellows, six technology transfer officers (TTOs) and six senior academics. Face‐to‐face interviews were conducted. Information was gathered through structured and semi‐structured open‐ended questions.
Findings – Fellows who accumulated human and social capital were able to act as agents of attitudinal change in their host departments. The fellows did not markedly change the culture towards commercialization, but they addressed several structural holes by building network bridges with actors positioned in practitioner networks. They created new weak ties with external actors who provided early stage funding, market and legal information and potential customers. Fellows also strengthened existing ties within academic networks both inter and intra university. The career destinations of the fellows after the scheme helped sustain bridging behaviour by providing points of contact for their peers and/or by demonstrating the viability of alternative sources of funding and prestige for academics.
Practical implications – Despite a widely perceived successful scheme, structural holes were still apparent in the monitored departments. Additional bridges need to be built between academic networks and actors, such as surrogate entrepreneurs and private equity financiers, to ensure the sustained development of new ventures.
Originality/value – Guided by insights from human and social capital theory and network theory the outcomes associated with a novel structured training initiative were monitored. Case study evidence was gathered from three types of university stakeholders (i.e. Medici fellows, TTOs and senior academics) involved in the commercialisation process.","Research paper","Published: 2007, Start page: 360"

Laitinen  (Department of Accounting and Finance, University of Vaasa, Vaasa, Finland)","This paper presents a model for predicting crises in small businesses using early‐warning signals. It summarises the results of two separate studies carried out in Finland (with 72 per cent response) and the UK (26 per cent) on the decision process of corporate analysts (Finland) and bank managers (UK) in predicting the failure of small and medium‐sized enterprises (SMEs). Both studies consist of seven main headings and over 40 sub‐headings of possible factors leading to failure. Weighted averages were used for both studies to show the importance of these factors. There are significant similarities in the results of the two studies. Management incompetence was regarded as the most important factor, followed by deficiencies in the accounting system and attitude towards customers. However, low accounting staff morale was considered a very important factor in Finland but not in the UK. Unlike Finland, the UK results emphasised the importance of accounting systems and internal control. These two studies differ from previous studies as managerial auditing elements like the importance of internal control departments (UK evidence) and budgetary control systems were included. Similarities in the results of these surveys conducted under two separate EU environments imply that it would be interesting and beneficial to extend these studies to other member states.","Small‐ to medium‐sized enterprises, Company failure, Accounting systems, Capital, Investment, Modelling","MCB UP Ltd","Published: 1999, Start page: 7"

Business performance measures are an important element of these financial management strategies. The paper discusses the findings from research carried out in the UK examining the quantitative and qualitative criteria in the measurement of performance in small firms. Semi‐structured interviews were carried out with 20 owner‐managers from both manufacturing and service sectors. Orthodox theory assumes that the objective of the firm is to maximise profits, and it follows that the performance measures advocated are largely based upon this theory. However, research has shown that small firms pursue a range of goals. It was, therefore, not surprising to find that owner‐managers of small firms used a variety of measures and indicators to assess business performance. Profit measures were found to be less important than conventional views suggest. In particular, cash flow indicators were considered to be critical. Other performance measures adopted by owner‐managers include the quality of inputs and outputs and intangible indicators.","Performance measurement, Objectives, Cash management, Small firms, Financial management","MCB UP Ltd","Published: 2000, Start page: 105"

Design/methodology/approach – This enquiry adopts a qualitative approach, whereby firms were identified from online searches, and secondary information was sought on each firm prior to in‐depth interview, in order to highlight the issues relating to internationalisation/growth.
Findings – The paper provides evidence that small games development firms undertake rapid internationalisation, despite resource constraints. Firms were founded by teams of entrepreneurs who unlike many other international entrepreneurs, did not have a priori experience, sometimes moving from being hobbyists into commercial operations. These often exist in a pre‐natal phase some years before formal incorporation, an important phase when many of the resources required are sourced. The findings show only partial support for RBV, as these firms were acquiring and controlling resources from their environment on a freelance and low commitment basis. The authors speculate that these firms display dynamic capabilities of the highest order in order to do so.
Research/limitations/implications – This enquiry adds to understanding of the (international) growth strategies of small games development firms, and gives insight into how they access dynamic capabilities. However, the number of firms investigated is small and from two Eastern European countries, therefore further larger scale research should be undertaken.
Originality/value – Based on this exploration new insights are developed with regard to an under researched sector, and how such firms undertake rapid internationational growth, despite being particularly resource constrained. In particular, the entrpreneurs in these firms have little experience and creatively acquire and control resources in order to grow rapidly.

As an explanation of why people want their own (autonomous) business it is tautological. This study sets out to focus on an explanation of the autonomy motive itself: why small business starters want autonomy.
Design/methodology/approach – Data were collected using semi‐structured interviews with a sample of 167 nascent entrepreneurs.
Findings – There are two types of autonomy motives: a proximal motive which is associated with task characteristics of being self‐employed (decisional freedom), and distal motives for which autonomy is instrumental (to avoid a boss or restrictions; to act in a self‐endorsed and self‐congruent manner; and to be in charge).
Research limitations/implications – Autonomy measures should either operationalise autonomy only in a proximal sense without regard to underlying motive sources, or take distal motives into account and offer items that reflect these autonomy motive sources.
Practical implications – Persons who resist bosses and rules now must be a boss and set rules themselves. People who want to express their personality and creativity in their work might be so busy and occupied that there will be little space left for personality and creativity expression. People who want autonomy because of the power and control it brings them may find that as a small business owner they have to deal with several types of uncertainty. Practitioners must resolve these tensions.
Originality/value – In spite of the intimate relationship between freedom and entrepreneurial motivation, this is perhaps the first paper to focus exclusively on autonomy as a start‐up motive.","Research paper","Published: 2006, Start page: 7"

Grounding the theoretical model in resource-based theory; this study conceptualizes how high-performance work system (HPWS) can enhance organizational innovation of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) through voice behaviors. Specifically, the purpose of this paper is to empirically test if employee voice mediates the relationship between HPWS and organizational innovation.Design/methodology/approachThis study used a quantitative strategy and cross-sectional survey method for the collection of data from SMEs operating in Pakistan. A list of SMEs was obtained from the federal government organization responsible for the development of SMEs in Pakistan. A self-administered structured questionnaire was distributed and 239 randomly selected SMEs responded to the survey.FindingsFindings confirmed the conceptualized model and revealed that HPWS was significantly and positively related to employee voice and organizational innovation. Employee voice was found as a significant predictor of organizational innovation and mediating factor in the relationship between HPWS and organizational innovation.Research limitations/implicationsThis study is limited in terms of variables included in the conceptual model and relatively small size of the sample that was derived from a single federal organization. More variables and SMEs can be included in future studies to get broader results and, potentially, better findings.Practical implicationsSME managers/owners can design HR function in such a way that employees will be encouraged to raise their voice and participate more in the organization. Scholars should study voice behaviors distinct from citizenship behaviors.Originality/valueThis study is the first of its kind to conceptualize the relationship between HPWS, employee voice, and organizational innovation in SMEs of Pakistan.","Research paper","Published: 2017, Start page: 670"

A similar situation probably exists in the firms that participate in training; a lack of robustness in the way they ensure a relationship between the training selected and the needs of employees in the context of their jobs. This paper explores the issues facing both firms and government agencies in New Zealand as they make decisions about investing in training as an enterprise development strategy. It is suggested that the way in which firms and government agencies behave in relation to training investment decisions is flawed: those involved follow received wisdom, act upon hunches and appear indifferent to ensuring that their respective investments are maximised. This situation will continue until it is realised that training is a key developmental strategy and gaining value from training events means that more rigour needs to be applied to planning and evaluation.","Small to medium‐sized enterprises, Government training agencies, Training evaluation, New Zealand","Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Published: 2004, Start page: 427"

The comments and suggestions made by the journal's referees have also been very helpful. The usual disclaimer applies.","Purpose – As a means of contributing to the literature surrounding the evolution and growth of firms, this paper seeks to outline the explanatory concept of growth trigger points. It aims to examine the forces that propel firms towards different stages of growth and argues that high‐growth firms (HGFs) often encounter important “trigger points” that can affect their growth capabilities. The paper's main aim is to define, conceptualise and illustrate the role of trigger points in promoting rapid growth within businesses.
Design/methodology/approach – The primary methodological approach used was intensive case study research of HGFs in Scotland. The case studies, 40 firms in total, were compiled using a mixed method research approach that included, inter alia, background desk research, firm interviews and interviews with business advisers.
Findings – The research discovered that growth trigger points are extremely diverse and play a major role in shaping the growth trajectory of firms, and highlights three main types of trigger points. While trigger points can fundamentally reconfigure organisations, providing a catalyst for a business to undertake a period of rapid, transformative growth, these events can conversely cause severe organisational turbulence or even decline. Often the critical period determining the ultimate success of the growth opportunity presented is the post‐trigger transition period identified by the authors.
Practical implications – The paper aims to inform public policy on how to support high‐growth entrepreneurship. From a policy perspective, understanding these trigger points is essential for helping policymakers to prioritise and optimise their interventions to help promote rapid firm growth.
Originality/value – The paper's unique contribution to the literature is to help conceptualise how firms move along a growth trajectory, by introducing the novel concept of growth “trigger points”. The paper also seeks to inform public policy, so that interventions can be better attuned to the requirements of dynamic growth businesses.","Conceptual paper","Published: 2013, Start page: 249"

This analysis involves examining the interaction process between the two parties, determining how the role of bankers is perceived and studying how banks as organisations function.
Design/methodology/approach – In the study a total of 60 interviews are conducted, of which 45 are conducted with SME owners. For this specific study, data drawn from in depth interviews conducted with SME owners and with bankers are presented.
Findings – The following main factors affect the adaptation process and can help explain the difficulties of banks to adapt to their SME customers: the lack of communication and contact in the interaction process, the lack of knowledge and competence of individual bankers as regards their customers' specific businesses and the centralised and standardised system that prevails within the banking organisation. Also, in this study it is found that the organisational structure influences how individual bankers perceive themselves and their ability to adapt to the needs of SMEs, which in turn affects the individual bankers' adaptability when interacting with their SME customers.
Originality/value – To the best of the authors' knowledge, adaptation has not been examined in relation to the concepts of interaction, role and organisation, or within the banking industry.","Research paper","Published: 2009, Start page: 544"

There is, however, only limited anecdotal evidence of the positive contribution that networks are a way of upgrading organisational learning and thereby enhancing the performance of small firms. Additionally, there appears to be minimal guidance available on how small firms might exploit networks as a route for improving their capabilities to acquire and utilise knowledge to enhance future performance. To acquire additional empirical data on these issues, a survey was undertaken to examine the learning style of small UK manufacturing firms participating in some form of cooperative relationship with other members of their market supply chain. Learning style in the survey was measured by seeking response to a scale which permits assessment of the degree to which the respondent firm is exhibiting a single‐ versus double‐loop learning style. A survey of small firms advisers to gain their view of the organisational competency was measured using a scale that identifies those areas of capability that have significant impact on the performance of small firms. Results indicate that firms involved in networks tend to adopt a double‐loop (or higher‐order) learning style, whereas non‐network firms mainly appear to be autonomous single‐loop learners. When compared with non‐network firms, respondent organisations who participate in networks tend to have a better developed, more formalised knowledge management system. Furthermore, small firm advisers perceive that the creation of a formalised knowledge management system is reflected by such firms exhibiting a higher level of organisational competence across some of the areas of marketing, HRM and information management. The implications of these findings are discussed in relation to how small firms might be assisted in becoming involved in learning networks as a path for improving their knowledge management capabilities. Some qualitative, illustrative examples of small business learning networks are provided. Additionally, proposals are presented on the need for further research.","Networks, Manufacturing, Learning, Knowledge, Small firms","MCB UP Ltd","Published: 2000, Start page: 105"

This study seeks to explore this issue in the specific context of e‐commerce and information system integration, by considering the model proposed by Poon and Swatman, in the case of small‐ and medium‐sized enterprises (SMEs) in the UK. Poon and Swatman propose that the model of business transformation enabled by traditional IT turns “inside out” when applied to the e‐commerce domain. Their model suggests a hierarchy of levels of e‐commerce integration. At the lowest level firms develop inter‐organisational systems. At the next level they undertake limited integration with existing internal systems, and only at the highest level do they achieve full internal integration. The study, which was carried out by a mailed questionnaire, found that the proposed model is indeed valid. Three distinct groups of firms are identified that correspond to the hierarchical levels proposed in the model. The benefits realised by the firms were found to increase with increasing integration, but the level of process change required was found to be independent of the level of integration. Contextual variables, such as industry sector and organisational size, are explored for firms at the three different levels of integration. Developments of the Poon and Swatman model are suggested.","Electronic commerce, Small‐ to medium‐sized enterprises, Systems engineering, United Kingdom","MCB UP Ltd","Published: 2003, Start page: 233"

Design/methodology/approach – The approach analysed the main growth factors and their influence on the adoption of different growth strategies. An online questionnaire was designed using Snap survey software™, with results exported to SPSS™ for analysis. Both quantitative and qualitative data were collected via a variety of scaled, open‐ended, rank order, dichotomous, multiple choice and open questions.
Findings – The research indicates that most do not opt to develop growth‐oriented businesses, choosing instead small, non‐scalable, locally focused businesses providing services or operating in low‐tech industries. Women who are growth‐oriented appear to be inhibited due to a lack of access to, and control over such resources as, capital, business premises, information and technology, production inputs, appropriate childcare, qualifications, experience, training facilities and appropriate assistance from business development agencies. Non‐effective accumulation and use of social capital hinders access to appropriate decision‐making circles, and limits the probability of accessing critical management and financing resources, especially through the venture capital industry.
Practical implications – This research has implications for government or other business development agencies seeking to understand the growth patterns and problems of women‐owned enterprises in the East of England.

Hence, SEEs are run specifically to provide employment. SEEs, with the exception of Remploy, represent a unique sector of SMEs owned and run by local authorities and charities. The Supported Employment Procurement and Consultancy Service (SEPACS) provides SEEs with per capita funding for disabled employees, capital grants for premises and equipment, grants for marketing research, business advice and performance monitoring. SEPACS is part of the Department for Education and Employment (DfEE). This paper presents some case studies of SEEs in the Yorkshire area. The work explains the complex dificulties facing these organisations and illustrates the different approaches used to cope with these situations. Many SEEs are under threat of closure or radical change in their function as employers of disabled people. This work investigates these issues through selected illustrative case studies. The general weakness of marketing strategies and plans in these organisations is highlighted and related to the impact of SEPACS and local authority policies and practices. This work establishes the important role that marketing strategies and plans could have in ensuring the future survival and growth of these companies.","Employment agencies, Disabled people, Marketing strategy, Local authorities, United Kingdom","MCB UP Ltd","Published: 2001, Start page: 205"

Design/methodology/approach – The paper adopts a multiple case study approach, studying the best practices of eight HBIBs.
Findings – The study finds that HBIBs generate variety because of the unique way in which they operate, and because of the reasons why they are started. How HBIBs operate can be captured in the acronym SMILES: Speed, Multiple income, Inexpensive, LEan, and Smart. They are founded (amongst other motives) for reasons of autonomy, freedom and independence. Both aspects – the how and why – of HBIBs are conducive to the creation of variety as they facilitate trial‐and‐error commercialisation of authentic ideas.
Research limitations/implications – Five theoretical perspectives posit that variety is important for the industry and the economy: evolutionary theory, strategic management, organic urban planning, opportunity recognition, and the knowledge economy. The findings are discussed in the context of each perspective, showing how HBIBs play a role in each perspective.
Practical implications – Policy makers should be aware of the importance of HBIBs, which can be promoted, providing generic facilities for business information, training, and mentoring, and by making compliance burdens more proportional to business size.
Originality/value – The paper shows how and why HBIBs are drivers of variety. This paper argues, by means of five theoretical perspectives, that because of the variety HBIBs generate, they contribute to the economy over and above their direct and indirect contributions in terms of revenue and employment.","Research paper","Published: 2008, Start page: 8"

The data set addressed is the published proceedings of the ‘UKEMRA’ annual research conferences, which constitute the most comparable relevant source of research output between the late 1970s and the early 1990s. This paper focuses specifically on the changing nature of the production process in SME research. It demonstrates that there has been a strong trend towards institutionalisation, with a shift in the modal form of production from sole workers to research teams. Furthermore, these teams have increasingly worked across institutions and, in a significant proportion of cases, collaboration has extended beyond academics to potential users/funders of research output. Finally, there appears to be little continuity between those active at the beginning and end of the time period reviewed.

The World Wide Web (WWW) is one approach to overcoming obstacles by giving organizations a direct connection to potential customers and suppliers on a global level. However, complex technology, security, and reliability present significant challenges to the entrepreneur or small business owner about to enter the e‐business arena. Difficulties are especially notable when the business operates in a non‐Web‐related field or when it has relatively few individuals with IT (information technology)/Web experience. Facing these challenges alone by hiring or developing an in‐house technology staff and building a support infrastructure is costly and may be risky. An alternative, contracting for Web‐based services from an application service provider (ASP), effectively reduces cost and risk while preserving the competitive advantage of the entrepreneurial firm.

Design/methodology/approach – A review of articles published during the last 25 years is carried out in order to answer the question: How does the top manager influence growth in small firms?
Findings – Three key relationships are identified: between growth and, respectively, managerial traits and characteristics, managerial intentions, and managerial behavior or roles. The diverse findings in the literature are contradictory and give a paradoxical picture of the impact of the manager. A deeper analysis of the results from the review, supplemented with leadership theory, yields a better understanding of small‐firm growth with a special focus on the behavior of the manager.
Research limitations/implications – This paper problematizes the complexity in managing small‐firm growth, and can be further empirically validated by using multiple methods including qualitative ones such as observational studies.
Practical Implications – The findings have a bearing on education and policy implications. If a behavior can be identified that promotes small firms' growth, education and policy implications can be developed in line with these results.
Originality/value – In small firms there seems to be a general consensus that managers do influence the performance of small firms, but so far there has not been a systematic review of earlier empirical research, that is done in this paper. From this review, a more complete picture of how managers influence growth in small firms is presented.","Literature review","Published: 2009, Start page: 544"

In order to remain competitive in a deregulated industry that has more or less encroached on all financial service providers, insurance companies and their sales representatives have had to reevaluate their traditional methods of attracting and keeping customers. To be successful in this endeavor, agents must take a closer look at just how they treat their customers.

The specific issues considered are the extent to which HR practices operate formally or informally, the attitudes of owner‐managers towards them and the extent to which the attitudes expressed are consistent with their use. The results indicate a very high take‐up rate for each of ten specific practices identified in the survey. In most instances this is reflected in the utilization of informal practices rather than formal systems. Similarly, owner‐managers exhibit positive attitudes towards five of the six HR dimensions adopted for the study, suggesting a consistency between practices and attitudes.

Research results indicate that higher‐performing Chinese small firms adopt the customer orientation, use a proactive approach in strategic planning, are aware and make use of marketing planning tools, adopt long‐term profit objectives, participate actively in new product development, and introduce new ways of doing business. Also, the higher‐performing Chinese small firms have well‐organised marketing organisation and encourage free communication flow and interaction among employees. To have better control over marketing activities, higher‐performing Chinese small firms frequently use marketing control devices.

Design/methodology/approach – The research framework allows for a comparison of predictions drawn from social psychological, economic, and management literature. The hypotheses are tested using ordinary least squares hierarchical regression analyses conducted on a nonrandom sample of medium and large family businesses.
Findings – The empirical results identify four potential categories of responsible ownership behaviors: professionalism, active governance, owner as resource, and basic duties. Professionalism (i.e. acting in accordance with expectations and agreements among owners and in relation to the firm) is the only behavior positively associated with financial performance. The effect of active governance (i.e. the monitoring of management) on financial performance is moderated by business size – this behavior has a negative effect on the dependent variable for all but the largest firms in the sample.
Research limitations/implications – The limitations of the current research and directions for further research include issues related to sampling, other possible variables to be explored, and alternative validations of the responsible ownership concept.
Practical implications – This study has direct practical implications for owners' actions in relation to one another and with other actors in the firm.

Self‐employed were more likely to be found in sectors where start‐up and sunk costs are expected to be lower (such as services and trade), those sectors that experienced high growth (construction) and in the regions in which entrepreneurship is more developed. In contrast with previous studies, it is found that education received household remittances and the presence of an additional wage earner in a household have negative impact on entrepreneurial activities arising from country‐specific features.
Research limitations/implications – These empirical findings identified determinants influencing entrepreneurial activities providing basis for policy discussion aimed at entrepreneurship development in the country.
Originality/value – The paper complements rather scarce empirical evidence on determinants of entrepreneurship from a unique transition country. It highlights the role of some transition and country‐specific factors in entrepreneurial activity of the population, providing better insights in understanding entrepreneurial behaviour of people in general and in transition economies in particular.","Research paper","Published: 2009, Start page: 7"

More specifically, it investigates the significance of formal (bank) sources of finance relative to that of informal (family or personal) sources of finance at start‐up and the implications of that reliance on subsequent business expansion. The paper also examines the wider role of informal family and community networks in providing access to information and labour, in addition to capital, and the impact of these support networks on business expansion. The methodology used is that of quantitative, statistical analysis supplemented by qualitative survey data. The evidence suggests that both formal and informal institutional support have played a limited role in fostering Asian entrepreneurial expansion in Britain. Although bank finance was valuable in preventing undercapitalised ventures, rapidly growing Asian businesses did not rely on bank finance either at start‐up or for expansion. This may be attributed to the short‐term perspective of banks. Rapidly growing Asian businesses did not rely on formal sources of advice. Nor did they rely on family or community networks for finance or labour. The Asian entrepreneurs who rapidly expanded their businesses invested their personal savings at start‐up, relied on their family and friends for advice, employed non‐Asian labour and invested in employee training. These results imply that Asian entrepreneurs aspiring to grow need to advance beyond the traditional reliance on informal support networks for finance and labour. Formal institutions could offer long‐term debt or equity finance, encourage investment in employee training, and provide appropriate training schemes.","Entrepreneurialism, Ethnic groups, Growth, Banks, Finance, Family firms, Start‐ups","MCB UP Ltd","Published: 1998, Start page: 297"

Unfortunately, the decisive role of compulsory schooling has long been neglected in this context. Until recently it was considered sufficient to provide education in entrepreneurship in universities (especially in the area of Business Administration) or in the form of special courses for people who consider starting their own business. Picking up the discussion at this point, the purpose of this paper is to analyse to what extent compulsory school education in Germany and Sweden facilitates a more entrepreneurial way of thinking among pupils.
Design/methodology/approach – First, the paper briefly summarises the relevant research literature and specify important components of entrepreneurship education. Second, it discusses what exactly is to be understood by entrepreneurial qualities and present a holistic approach based on a model by Dahlgren. Third, it describes the unique data and presents some empirical results. The empirical analysis concentrates on Germany. Yet, for reasons of comparison, it additionally analyses the situation in Sweden. Finally, the paper summarises the results and discusses the policy implications.
Findings – The results presented clearly suggest that German schools do not succeed very well in presenting self‐employment as an attractive alternative to dependent work. Swedish pupils generally show a higher preference for self‐employment than their German counterparts. Furthermore, the results suggest that German schools diminish rather than encourage pupils' ambitions to become self‐employed as the pupils become older.
Originality/value – To the authors' knowledge this is the first empirical study which compares the effect of different school systems on entrepreneurial attitude simultaneously (i.e. with the same questionnaire and at the same point of time).","Research paper","Published: 2008, Start page: 239"

The purpose of this paper is to investigate how such characteristics can sustain in different industrial environments.
Design/methodology/approach – By using the competency approach on a sample of 153 SME owner/managers in the wholesale trade and IT services industries, we conducted hypothesis testing on comparing first, the overall rankings of ten competency areas for SME owner/managers, and second, the ratings of individual competency areas between the two industries.
Findings – While there are consistent patterns of competencies across these two contrasting industries in Hong Kong, the owner/managers in IT services industry have significantly higher ratings in innovative, strategic and learning competencies than those in the wholesale trade industry.
Research limitations/implications – Entrepreneurial competencies are not only stimulated or sharpened by the requirements of different industrial environments, but also rooted in the common socio‐cultural background of the owner/managers.
Practical implications – With the ever closer economic and socio‐cultural integration with China, a completely new pattern of entrepreneurial competencies may be required in a new context of entrepreneurship in Hong Kong.

Rather than ‘force‐fitting’ functional management systems into business plans with little synergy or linkage between them, Second Generation Management first identifies the comprehensive needs of the business.

This is particularly evident within the small firm sector. The literature, which considers this issue, concludes that there are a number of reasons why small firm owners are, on the whole, reluctant to invest in such training for themselves and their employees. Such reasons include, ignorance of benefits, time issues, fear that training will enhance employee mobility and, critically, that there is little evidence to indicate that investment in training and development leads to enhanced firm performance. On the basis that there has been some debate and empirical investigation regarding why training does not take place, this paper takes an alternative stance and considers what issues and processes might underpin the decision to invest in training ‐ particularly management training. Findings are drawn from empirical research on a sample of firms where investment had been made in such training in the last 24 months; the indications being that such investment was not strategic or proactive but prompted by problems which threatened business performance.","Human resource management, Training, Organizational learning, Small firms","MCB UP Ltd","Published: 2002, Start page: 236"

Design/methodology/approach – This study compares the social capital profiles of early‐stage entrepreneurs in England with distinct occupational classifications – i.e. entrepreneurs who were completing training on the Science and Enterprise Challenge (SEC) initiative and pursuing professional and higher technician businesses, and entrepreneurs who were completing training on the New Entrepreneurship Scholarship (NES) initiative and who were residing in deprived areas, unemployed or underemployed and pursuing non‐professional businesses. The European Socio‐economic Classification (ESeC) was adopted to classify occupation. The entrepreneurs completed aided name generator questionnaires and in‐depth interviews.
Findings – The findings demonstrate that professional and higher technician entrepreneurs have higher levels of bridging and diverse resources when compared to non‐professional entrepreneurs residing in deprived areas. The non‐professional entrepreneurs also seem over‐reliant on too much bonding.
Practical implications – Policy makers strive to understand who has the most productive social capital when launching a business and who does not. The findings may help provide an initial awareness that across the board entrepreneurial policies are inappropriate, as the building of social capital seems contextual.
Originality/value – The high bridging social capital of professional and higher technician entrepreneurs could enable “getting ahead” and could be entrepreneurial/innovative “facilitating social capital”. The non‐professional entrepreneurs residing in deprived areas' over‐reliance on bonding social capital could be a liability and entrepreneurial/innovative “inhibiting social capital”.","Research paper","Published: 2013, Start page: 453"

This paper contributes to the debate about Business Link effectiveness by assessing the evidence of Business Link impact from a number of recent studies. The studies show that Business Links are beginning to make a positive impact but it is more difficult to analyse the extra value they are adding to SME growth. There is still some confusion about the Business Links target market – should they concentrate solely on established small firms with growth prospects or offer all their services to start‐ups and micro businesses as well? In some respects, Business Links themselves are going through the typical development stages that many SMEs go through in their establishment. Business Links can learn how different growth stages affect company development from this process. Business Links will only succeed in their mission to assist small firms if SMEs are attracted to using them. The main challenge facing Business Links is to move towards a private sector locally led orientation, as opposed to previous initiatives which were largely national and public sector led. There are elements of a virtuous circle in the SME/Business Link relationship which can be exploited to encourage both business excellence and Business Link improvement. Bus9ness Links will achieve greater impact through effective partnership but this can only happen if partnerships are well balanced with no one partner dominating.","Partnering, Small‐ to medium‐sized enterprises, Growth","MCB UP Ltd","Published: 1998, Start page: 7"

In addition to exploring retrospective perceptions, the research sought to ascertain the current level of entrepreneurial behaviour and the future entrepreneurial ambitions of alumni, and attempted to determine the demand for post‐qualification entrepreneurship training among HEI alumni. The results are encouraging, in that they demonstrate a keen interest amongst alumni in entrepreneurial activities. The main constraints to setting up in business were perceived to be the generation of a viable idea and the lack of both finance and experience. Respondents believed that HEIs should provide a more practical grounding for graduates, specifically citing financial management and business communications skills as key elements missing from the undergraduate curriculum. There was a consensus that HEIs have an important role to play in providing alumni with both formal post‐qualification training and social support networks to encourage entrepreneurial activity.","Higher education, Graduates, Entrepreneurialism, Training, Start‐ups","MCB UP Ltd","Published: 1999, Start page: 215"

This paper takes an initial “sounding” of our understanding about the transition of graduates into such organisations. While research data provides some insight into the barriers which work to discourage more SMEs from recruiting graduates, this understanding appears inadequate and insufficiently segmented to provide a detailed knowledge of the problems. A prevailing assumption is that graduates lack skills required by SME employers. Yet the limited research findings reveal ambiguity about the extent to which SMEs effectively deploy graduate labour. The article proposes an agenda that highlights the need for two types of research. First, a clearer picture of current trends in the SME graduate labour market. Second, a richer understanding of the real experience of graduates, and their managers, in relation to employment in an SME and the implications of such for both the supply and demand sides of the graduate labour market.","Competitiveness, United Kingdom, Graduates, Employment, Small‐ to medium‐sized enterprises","MCB UP Ltd","Published: 2002, Start page: 236"

A particular focus of attention is the informal learning practices that occur within the economic and social networks utilised by managers in this sector. Using both qualitative and quantitative approaches to data collection, the paper investigates the challenges perceived by managers engaged (or seeking to engage) in international activity. The results suggest three main areas of challenge: first, the early “pre‐internationalisation” stage, when decisions about “whether”, “where” or “how” to internationalise are taken; secondly, the development of longer‐term planning processes and business systems to cope with the consequences of the initial internationalisation decision; thirdly, the challenge of regulatory issues and the need to secure payment and manage foreign intermediaries. Further areas of learning need, which depend on the significance of international business for the firm, are also indicated. Existing structures, cultures and approaches to management can be maintained for many SMEs that undertake some limited international activity. Where international business is a more important factor, however, managers need to develop cultural appreciation and empathy to underpin their expertise and consolidate their market position. Indeed, sustained international development may require a significant reorienting of the business, underpinned by management and organisational learning to develop an appropriate international “mind‐set” that supports the effective development of relationships with stakeholders in different countries.","Learning, Small‐ to medium‐sized enterprises, Training, Management development, International trade","MCB UP Ltd","Published: 2001, Start page: 205"

Design/methodology/approach – The theories of monopsony and oligopsony are applied to intermediate markets to set out a model of profit appropriation by large buyers from small suppliers. The main focus of the illustrative examples used is on the relationship between supermarkets and their suppliers.
Findings – The authors' main prediction is that powerful buyers are able to “exploit” SME suppliers by restricting their number, the price paid to individual suppliers and the quantity purchased from each supplier.
Practical implications – Governments seek to encourage small businesses because of their ability to generate innovation and create future growth opportunities. Any investigations of the continued growth of buyer power in intermediate markets should consider the effects not only upon consumer welfare but also upon the welfare of the SME sector. Governments may wish to counteract monopsonistic markets as they may inhibit SMEs that could otherwise provide innovation and growth within the economy.
Originality/value – This model gives a theoretical framework to analyse the interaction between small suppliers and large buyers. Furthermore, it may provide a counter to the argument that low consumer prices are the sole legitimate aim of competition policy.","Research paper","Published: 2012, Start page: 192"

With no real change or reduction in sight for the 17 million European Union citizens who are currently unemployed, a major concern of the European Commission is to develop policies which will encourage and foster employment opportunities. However, a significant problem, especially for the long‐term unemployed, is to ensure that they are equipped with up‐to‐date skills and knowledge to meet the challenges facing the European economy in the 21st century. It is generally accepted that small and medium‐sized firms have a major contribution to make to both economic development and, in turn, reducing unemployment. SMEs demand a skilled and flexible workforce and the European Commission recognises the need for policies which facilitate the development and continuous updating of workforce skills. Current European Union initiatives recognise the importance of integration and interdependency across member states but also recognise, and indeed emphasise, the role and contribution of local initiatives. These initiatives are enshrined in the European Employment Strategy which is founded upon four key priorities; employability, entrepreneurship, adaptability and equal opportunities. The creation, development and implementation of policy is based upon sound analysis which necessarily demands high‐quality applied research. This is an area in which academic institutions, in particular, can, should and do make a significant contribution. Currently, there is a need for further research across a broad spectrum of initiatives ranging from basic research covering topics such as enterprise demography through to broadening definitions of entrepreneurship and enterprise. A significant proportion of this work is, and will continue to be, supported and coordinated by the European Commission. Information sources describing the fundamental requirements and needs are available on the Internet.","Unemployment, Employment, Re‐skilling, Re‐training","MCB UP Ltd","Published: 1999, Start page: 215"

It describes how small firms in a university environment utilise their networks of social relations to cope with some of the problems typical for SMEs in a post‐socialist transitional economy. Moreover, the paper gives a brief account of how successful similar firms are supported by the newly developing business support infrastructure. The data for this paper derive from a larger PhD project on networking in a transitional economy and are based on semi‐structured interviews with entrepreneurs and representatives of organisations who were selected using the snowballing method. The paper looks at two groups of firms that were established by academics from technical universities in two western Polish regions. It compares these structures with formal policy initiatives in the two regions, which aim to support similar firms. The evidence shows how personal contacts remained both between the technical universities and the firms as well as between the individual firms. The use of these interpersonal relations can lead to an effective means of knowledge transfer between universities and the business sphere and can also serve as problem‐solving mechanisms for the small business. The organisation of the business support infrastructure, on the other hand, seem to be rather unsuccessful in addressing the problems of such university spin‐offs. The problems of acceptance and credibility that these bodies encounter are mainly rooted in the reluctance of private entrepreneurs to get involved with public or quasi‐public institutions, which in turn is a result of socialist legacies.","Small firms, Poland, Start‐ups, High technology, Universities","MCB UP Ltd","Published: 1999, Start page: 113"

Some research suggests that small businesses have little management information, poor control and that decision‐making is ad hoc. Other research suggests that small businesses acquire effective information and control through informal means, and that decision‐making can be sophisticated. This research addresses these apparent contradications by conducting a longitudinal, in‐depth exploration of the management information and decision‐making processes in four service sector businesses that have recently broken through the micro‐enterprise barrier. Multiple sources of evidence were used to construct a longitudinal history of information provision and decision‐making in each case. These included taped, oral, accounts of each owner‐manager’s life, focused semi‐structured interview questions and documentary evidence. The quality of the data has allowed a cross case causal network to be constructed which synthesises the evidence. This traces the chains of causality from the informal systems at the start of the businesses through to the later developments of more formal systems. This leads to a consideration of implications for small businesses, practitioners and policy makers.","Management information, Management control, Growth, BPR, Cash flow","MCB UP Ltd","Published: 1998, Start page: 297"

Employing institutional theory, the research aims to investigate the entrepreneurial environment, particularly government support programmes and the availability of financial resources, with a focus on women entrepreneurs.
Design/methodology/approach – This research is a qualitative investigation that comprises 60 interviews with Russian and Ukrainian entrepreneurs, bank officers and representatives of government organisations supporting the development of entrepreneurship.
Findings – The investigation provides evidence that these countries have overcome the transition from a command to a market economy and local people are gradually adjusting to the new environment. Concentrating on macro/meso and money elements from the 5M model suggested by Brush et al., the authors suggest an additional construct – “motherland” – to embed a context in a new model.
Research limitations/implications – Only two factors of Brush et al.'s 5M model were considered – i.e. macro/meso environment and money (availability of financial resources). Discussion of management, marketing and motherhood is beyond the scope of the present paper.
Practical implications – The study reveals a broad range of managerial information and empirical data on the development of female entrepreneurship in contemporary Russia and Ukraine. The findings are helpful for policymakers engaged with these two countries.
Originality/value – The study is an attempt to capture the context dependency of research on female entrepreneurs, and suggests a new dimension for inclusion in Brush et al.’s 5M model – “motherland”.","Research paper","Published: 2013, Start page: 249"

The purpose of this paper is to respond to call for a multi-perspectives examination of leadership succession in order to embrace the dynamic and complex nature of succession in a family business. Accordingly, the authors investigated the key personal and professional factors associated with effective family-business succession across four key stakeholders: incumbent, successor, family, and nonfamily members.Design/methodology/approachThe explanatory research design included 16 interviews in Phase 1 and 41 prospective case study interviews in Phase 2, both with Australian family businesses that had or were about to experience generational transition.FindingsIncumbents and successor interview findings support the benefits of maintaining a cohesive family business, adaptable family culture, and familiness for effective succession. The authors also identified several personal components (e.g. family-business socialization and external experiences) that can help determine the commitment of successors and how this commitment can change once they assume a leadership position. Business size was the professional component supported by incumbent, successor, and nonfamily members as having a significant impact on succession process. As family business grows and becomes more highly complex, a clearly defined set of procedures become imperative.Practical implicationsFamily-business practitioners can apply the findings to manage the processes and expectations of family and the business to achieve effective generational succession and thereby increase the sustainability of the business.Originality/valueThis research provides a coherent and comprehensive understanding of the interdependencies of competing priorities in the complex succession process that is essential for family-business sustainability and performance.","Research paper","Published: 2017, Start page: 670"

Tax planning practices of small firms in the UK, and the implications of these practices on working capital and investment in these businesses, are considered. The results indicate that tax planning in most small firms is not very sophisticated and this has an effect on investment decisions in these businesses. As a result of poor tax planning practices small firms are not in a position to utilise fully all available tax reduction mechanisms. Instead they have to rely on mechanisms that can be decided upon after the accounting year end; unfortunately these involve the withdrawal of money from the business (eg pension schemes, salaries/bonuses). The results presented in this paper illustrate that the decision concerning the level of pension fund contributions and drawings/salaries, and subsequently the level of retained profits, will depend on both financial (business needs and market characteristics) as well as non‐financial (management characteristics) factors. However, the present combination of these factors in the small business sector favours the extraction of profits out of the business rather than the reinvestment of profits that will enhance the creation of wealth and employment. Based on the beliefs and expectations of small business owner/directors a number of tax incentives are discussed that the government could introduce in order to enhance the financial development and prosperity of small firms.","Small firms, Capital investment, Taxation, UK","MCB UP Ltd","Published: 1999, Start page: 7"

It was developed to alleviate some of the fundamental problems that smaller firms face when seeking finance due to a lack of loan security, and the fact that some 33,500 firms have obtained funding under the scheme is an indicator of its success. The study uses econometric techniques to identify the influential determinants of LGS take‐up and failure rates. The results show that the two scheme parameters, the interest rate premium and the proportion of the loan guaranteed, were the key determinants of take‐up. On the other hand, failure rates were influenced by liquidity (cash flow), interest rates and other macroeconomic factors. We conclude that the government can directly influence the level of take‐up on the LGS by adjusting the two key parameters, namely the premium and the guarantee.","General review","Marc Cowling, Nick Clay,  (1994)  ""AN ASSESSMENT OF THE LOAN GUARANTEE SCHEME"", Journal of Small Business and Enterprise Development, Vol. 1 Issue: 3, pp.7-13, https://doi.org/10.1108/eb020940","Published: 1994, Start page: 1"

Design/methodology/approach – A telephone survey using a stratified random sample frame provides a representative sample that allows comparison of the benefits of advice to SMEs in different size categories.
Findings – The paper demonstrates a large and varied supply of advice with no evidence of reluctance by owners/managers to seek advice. “Hard” and “soft” outcomes tend to be combined for many SMEs, but the widest effects of external advice seem to be intangible, such as reassurance or reducing uncertainty. There is less variation between SMEs of different size than expected, but strong variation between types of external suppliers of advice. The level of regulation of suppliers and extent of their reputation or brand appear to have positive association with the level of their use, impact and satisfaction levels. Public sector advisers have special difficulties of managing quality and better relating marketing to what they can reliably deliver.
Originality/value – The research provides to researchers a better understanding of the form of intangible benefits that businesses receive from advice, and how these interrelate with “hard” benefits of reduced costs and increased profits. Private sector advisers need to note the interaction between feelings‐based and “hard” outcomes.

Design/methodology/approach – The research employs data for several thousand SMEs taken from the Australian federal government's Business Longitudinal Survey undertaken over four financial years from 1994‐1995 to 1997‐1998. The principal analytical technique employed is logistic regression modelling with various financial structure measures as dependent variables, and with industry as the independent variable of central interest.
Findings – The research findings reported in the paper provide substantial empirical evidence that cross‐industry differences in financing behaviour do exist even after controlling for other relevant influences on SME financing choices such as enterprise size, business age, profitability, growth, asset structure and risk. The key finding is that industry does not simply proxy for one or more of these other factors, but is an important influence in its own right.
Research limitations/implications – There are evidently effects arising from the fundamental nature of industries that require better understanding before a reliable prescriptive position on SME financing can be reached. What these effects are cannot really be ascertained using the research data and methods employed in this study, which give a relatively superficial perspective on the matter.

Small and medium enterprises (SMEs) are often regarded as important innovators in the economy. It is possible to protect some intellectual capital as property through formal legal rights such as patents or copyright or through contractual agreements. Where small businesses possess such intellectual property, they can secure legal proection. Business owners may also attempt to protect such property using informal methods such as keeping information confidential as “trade secrets”. To explore whether SMEs possess intellectual property and, if so, whether they attempt to protect it, results are presented from a study of SMEs in four sectors where such issues are likely to arise – computer services, design, electronics and mechanical engineering. Overall, small business owners placed most emphasis on informal methods to protect intellectual property. These methods were more familiar, cheaper, less time‐consuming and frequently considered as effective as more formal rights. Under most circumstances, SME owners considered formal registrable rights such as patents less important. Even where business owners adopted formal rights, they were generally reluctant to bring a legal action to obtain redress where they believed that infringements had taken place.","Small‐ to medium‐sized enterprises, Intellectual property, Innovation, Legal title","MCB UP Ltd","Published: 1998, Start page: 297"

Design/methodology/approach – The study collected data through 139 face‐to‐face structured interviews with Turkish ethnic entrepreneurs in London, UK.
Findings – The study illustrates that educational attainment of an entrepreneur makes a positive impact on a firm's entrepreneurial orientation. Educational attainment equips business owners with the skills and reflective mindsets of understanding customers and responding to their needs. Previous business experience of the entrepreneur also impacts positively upon a firm's entrepreneurial orientation, while religion of the entrepreneur does not have a significant impact on the firm's entrepreneurial orientation.
Research limitations/implications – This paper reports findings based on Turkish ethnic entrepreneurs in London. Therefore, care should be taken in making generalisations from the sample.
Practical implications – This paper identifies those socio‐cultural attributes that entrepreneurs can capitalise on in order to enhance the entrepreneurial orientation of their firms.

In the UK this has led to establishing the Better Payment Practice Group, and legislation to enforce a statutory right to interest on late payments. A number of surveys have highlighted the extent of the late payment problem and suggested possible causes for it but there has been relatively little work, theoretical and/or empirical on understanding the payment behaviours of firms. This paper builds on previously reported survey results and econometric analysis, to develop 13 small firm case studies where the management and financing of trade credit is analysed in detail. The case studies draw on a combination of qualitative and quantitative data from interview transcripts, questionnaire responses and secondary data. Credit management is examined from the firm’s perspective as both a supplier and a customer. Valuable information is provided on the extent of late payment and small firms’ perception and management of the problem. The analysis revealed that while late payment concerned all the firms interviewed some of them managed it better than others. At the extremes there were two distinct types of firms. Those who found late payment to be the greatest problem were “juggling” various forms of short‐term finance to fund their working capital. Their credit management procedures were ad hoc and unsystematic but there was no evidence that they were at the mercy of dominant customers. Firms who managed late payment had systematic credit management procedures in place, a good knowledge of when to expect payment from each of their customers and appeared to be more in control of the process. Longer‐term sources of finance provided them with the stability to plan ahead and there was sufficient flexibility in their financial structure to cope with minor hiccups.","Small firms, Finance, Financial management, Credit control, Case studies","MCB UP Ltd","Published: 1998, Start page: 297"

It focuses on active ownership, i.e. direct involvement of owners alongside employees as an important factor of FI and conducts hierarchical regression models with profitability as the dependent variable, FI as the independent variable, and FS/age as moderating variables. It also includes other firm characteristics as control variables.FindingsThe results show that even though active family ownership is positively associated with the profitability of SMEs, the relationship between FI and profitability is negatively moderated by FS and firm age (FA).Research limitations/implicationsThe limitations of this study are mainly related to the definition of family SMEs and to the cross-sectional data used to understand the variations in economic performance. However, the results show the great importance of this kind of study; more attention must be paid to heterogeneity due to the size and age of family businesses as well as the level of owners’ involvement alongside employees.Practical implicationsPractitioners are encouraged to maintain a higher degree of family ownership combined with a higher degree of active ownership in the initial stages, when family businesses are young and small. However, the level of active ownership should be reduced when family businesses increase in age and size. According to this study, practitioners should open up businesses to external human resources other than the owners’ family as the firm increases in size/age to avoid the risks associated with family members lacking talent and/or expropriating benefits.Originality/valueThis study is one of the first to give evidence on not only a direct (and positive) relationship between FI and economic performance, but also an indirect (and negative) moderating effect of FS and FA on this relationship.","Research paper","Published: 2017, Start page: 426"

Design/methodology/approach – The study is conducted in two stages: the first stage is a qualitative study consisting of eight focus groups and the second stage is a quantitative investigation comprising a postal survey of 108 respondents. The themes that guided the focus groups were developed through a review of existing literature. Those that informed the survey design emerged from the focus group findings.
Findings – The findings suggest that the decision to adopt a pension although triggered by a number of factors cannot be divorced from the context of operation of the firm, the market environment, the stage of the company's life cycle, and the general economic conditions. The other important contextual issue that influences the decision is the management's future objectives for the firm and the management style of the owner or owners.
Research limitations/implications – The limitations of this study are the over representation of certain industrial sectors in the sample from which the focus groups were formed, and the rate of response (38.6 per cent) to the survey.
Originality/value – The paper provides useful information on the factors affecting the setting up sponsored occupational pension schemes in small companies.","Research paper","Published: 2006, Start page: 299"

Kitchen  (Keele University, Keele, UK)","The response or non‐response of small businesses to change is an important area of study. Environmental analysis is a crucial corollary to business development and growth. However, experience of small firms has indicated that the managers of such enterprises may become myopic in relation to changes in the business environment, or may not respond to or notice slow change. This myopia or lethargy exhibited by small firms needs to be avoided if such firms are to survive and grow. Four crucial questions (where is the firm now; where is it heading if it takes no action to change things; where do we want the firm to be; and how might we take it there?) must be answered if small firms wish to survive and grow. It is recommended that environmental analysis coupled with the use of a creativity consultant may help small firms to develop strategies for adjusting to change and avoiding marketing myopia.","General review","Philip J.

It aims to investigate product management as a set of boundary spanning capabilities, by empirically relating these to firm performance.
Design/methodology/approach – A measurement instrument is developed and validated based on the extant product management literature. Using a heterogeneous sample of 63 Atlantic Canadian SMEs in the manufacturing and professional/technical services sectors, data are collected to test the survey instrument and establish preliminary construct validity.
Findings – Both firm performance and product management measures demonstrate internal consistency. Several product management sub‐constructs demonstrated reliability and in some cases validity, substantiating the product management literature. These included product pricing, sales support and forecasting.
Research limitations/implications – This research builds upon the literature and indicates that a relationship exists between product management capability and firm performance. This leads to the conclusion that product management, as a set of boundary spanning firm capabilities, warrants future research with a larger more homogeneous population. Limitations include geographic bias, treating the population as homogeneous and lack of relationship to established firm orientations.
Practical/implications – This research may have practical significance and managerial implications, based on the relationship between product management capabilities and firm performance. This could lead to an increased understanding of how to allocate scarce resources in order to improve performance.
Originality/value – The paper introduces the concept of boundary spanning, product management capabilities and their relationship to firm performance, by providing preliminarily validation of a measurement scale for product management capabilities of small to medium‐sized enterprises.","Research paper","Published: 2011, Start page: 655"

The empirical work suggests successful firms put much greater emphasis on the information required for long‐term strategic planning rather than the day to day operations of the business. The vast majority of the firms used internal sources for this information. Strong statistical evidence is presented to suggest that the firms under investigation actively use the information they collect for decision making, rather than simply paying lip service to the concept of market research. This work makes an important contribution to the literature, because it represents one of very few empirical studies which provide support for the widely held belief that collection and subsequent use of market information is an important feature of successful exporters’ behaviour.","Market research, Export, Small‐ to medium‐sized enterprises, Market information, Performance","MCB UP Ltd","Published: 2001, Start page: 205"

A tacit theme emerging from this area has been the need for entrepreneurs to develop a competency in using their PCNs as a means of resolving marketing problems faced in developing their enterprises. The competency literature itself focuses primarily on the subject of management development, with scant attention given to the identification of specific competences for small firm entrepreneurs and, in particular, the challenges they face in marketing decision‐making. Previous research by the authors addressed this shortcoming and pointed to the value of using PCNs for resolving marketing problems in the entrepreneurial small firm. A spectrum of entrepreneurial competences critical for marketing‐led enterprise development was developed. A conceptual model is proposed of how small firm entrepreneurs might use their existing competency strengths to develop a further competency in the proactive use of PCNs, a strength which is critical for the planned success of the entrepreneurial enterprise.","General review","Jimmy Hill, Pauric McGowan,  (1996)  ""MARKETING DEVELOPMENT THROUGH NETWORKING: A COMPETENCY BASED APPROACH FOR SMALL FIRM ENTREPRENEURS"", Journal of Small Business and Enterprise Development, Vol. 3 Issue: 3, pp.148-156, https://doi.org/10.1108/eb020974","Published: 1996, Start page: 109"

Boocock  (The Business School, Loughborough University, Loughborough, Leics)","This paper presents findings from a major research study investigating management training and development (MTD) activity within small and medium‐sized enterprises (SMEs) in the East Midlands. Despite the fact that the academic evidence linking training and development with business performance remains inconclusive, the previous UK Government clearly signalled the importance of improving skills levels to promote business success. The Training and Enterprise Councils (TECs) are charged with a key role in stimulating MTD activity within SMEs, a sector where MTD has traditionally been given a low priority. The system of government‐backed support for SMEs is currently under review, and the continued existence of the TECs in their present form largely depends upon their ability to provide proactive, tailored solutions to local business needs. It is, therefore, an extremely opportune time to review the TECs’ performance. Based on detailed analysis of the activities of six TECs in the East Midlands, the paper examines how they define MTD, establish the MTD needs of SMEs within their respective catchment areas, and formulate appropriate strategies to meet those needs. The reasons why generic MTD products are not generally taken up by SMEs are explored; supply‐side obstacles hinder the promotion of generic products by the TECs and demand is constrained as owner‐managers are reluctant to adopt such initiatives, although the boundaries between these two sets of factors are blurred. After reviewing the ways in which the TECs evaluate their activities, the paper concludes by offering some recommendations as to how the TECs could increase the take‐up of MTD by SMEs and improve the targeting of SMEs for assistance.","Management development, Training, Training and Enterprise Councils, Samll‐ to medium‐sized enterprises","MCB UP Ltd","Published: 1999, Start page: 113"

Small- and medium-sized firms present a high-speed adjustment towards the target STD ratio, suggesting that both types of firm face costs of deviating from the target capital structure, which are, probably, greater than the costs of adjustment associated with STD. However, considering the distance from the target ratio as a determinant of the adjustment speed, the results show the predominance of the negative effect of the costs of adjustment on capital structure adjustment speeds.Originality/valueThe results obtained for the speed of adjustment of STD and LTD, in a recession context, show that for small firms and medium-sized firms, mainly for the former, the costs of external market transactions are prohibitively high, slowing the speed of adjustment towards the target capital structure.","Research paper","Published: 2017, Start page: 426"

Few studies have assessed the importance of relational governance to the performance of these partnerships. The purposes of this research were to determine the effect of relational governance on the performance of financial partnerships and to compare biotechnology manager assessments of their financial and non‐financial partnerships.
Design/methodology/approach – Interviews were conducted with managers of emerging biotechnology companies and lead investors in Canada, France and Germany. Relational governance was assessed by relational norms such as flexibility, information sharing, solidarity and fairness. Performance was assessed by overall effectiveness and partnership benefits. First, the contribution of relational governance to partnership effectiveness and benefits was examined. Second, for the financial partnerships, the perceptions of both biotech managers and lead investors were compared. Third, the biotech manager perceptions of their financial and non‐financial partnerships were compared.
Findings – Relational governance is positively associated with performance. Communication (information sharing) was most predictive of partnership performance. Biotech managers view their financial partnerships as being less relational than do their lead investors. Also, biotech managers view their financial partnerships to be less relational than those with their non‐financial partners.
Originality/value – The findings extend our knowledge of the positive influence of relational governance from longer lasting exchanges to “interimistic” technology partnerships. The communication of pertinent and timely information is particularly relevant for both biotech managers and lead investors and can allay fears of opportunistic behaviour and develop trust and commitment.","Research paper","Published: 2005, Start page: 307"

The latest survey was promoted and supported by Yorkshire Forward (the Yorkshire and Humberside Regional Development Agency) and Yorkshire Universities. Previous iterations have also been supported by Yorkshire Forward together with HE development funds via the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) and the Higher Education Innovation Fund (HEIF).","Purpose – This paper aims to address the need for a re‐focused research agenda in relation to graduate entrepreneurship. An important theme for some years has been the effort to monitor attitudes and intentions of students towards starting up their own businesses. It is timely, however, to raise some questions about both the impact of this research and likewise the general approach it has taken in understanding the phenomenon of graduate entrepreneurship.
Design/methodology/approach – The paper draws on a large data set (over 8,000 students) from one UK region. Specifically, it presents data from the 2007/2008 Entrepreneurial Intentions (EI) survey within the Yorkshire and Humberside region and reflects back over previous iterations of this research.
Findings – The paper identifies three key outcomes. First, it establishes that across all years of the survey a substantial minority of students consistently hold relatively strong start‐up intentions. Second, the paper highlights that, despite considerable efforts to increase the numbers moving to start‐up, little impact is discernible. Third, the paper suggests that, although the EI survey is useful as a stock‐taking exercise, it fails to address critical questions around the impact of higher education on entrepreneurship and the transition from entrepreneurial intent to the act of venture creation.
Originality/value – The paper provides an important positioning perspective on the relationship between higher education and graduate entrepreneurship. While highlighting the importance of the EI research, the paper establishes the need for a re‐focused research agenda; one that is conceptually robust and with a focus on the student journey from higher education to graduate entrepreneur.","Research paper","Published: 2010, Start page: 500"

Through the application of existing frameworks we seek to highlight the importance of location to small independent retailers in the context of outdoor leisure retailing. The case of “UpFront”, a pseudonym for a retailer operating four outlets in Great Britain, is presented. It is shown that, although based largely on luck and opportunism, the firm's locational “strategy” has been crucial to its success as a leading player in the sector. Based on detailed interviews with the managing director and employees, the role and importance of location as a critical success factor to the organisation is presented. In conclusion, a call is made for greater engagement with the nuances of location to small retail organisations, given its impact on a large number of retail operations.","Localization, Decision making, Retailing, Small enterprises, United Kingdom","Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Published: 2004, Start page: 159"

Using exploratory qualitative empirical evidence, it is proposed that there are four “frames” of perceiving the social perspective of the small business. These are profit‐maximisation priority, subsistence priority, enlightened self‐interest and social priority. If policy makers wish to influence the ethics of small firms, they need to be aware of this diversity of viewpoints and move beyond the notion of the profit‐maximising, rational economic entrepreneur as the standard image of the small business owner‐manager.","Ethics, Social responsibility, Profit maximisation, Motivation, Small firms","MCB UP Ltd","Published: 2001, Start page: 113"

The purpose of the article is to explore the changing role of university scientists towards venture creation, and understand the influence of university‐driven initiatives for venture creation.
Design/methodology/approach – The article is based on a qualitative study of two venture creation cases: one from a US university, and one building from two universities in Sweden. The cases and associated university environments were selected due to their venture creation activity. University venture creation data of the three universities complements the cases.
Findings – Venture creation at universities can be more compatible with the traditional role of the university scientist. Centers and laboratories concerned with entrepreneurship and action‐based education are identified as key university resources allowing university scientists to engage in venture creation in more compatible ways, and not having to become the lead venture creator.
Research limitations/implications – The study underlying the article is limited to three university environments (in two countries) where venture creation activity is relatively frequent.
Originality/value – The article shows that venture creation can be more compatible with the role of the university scientist due to more collective entrepreneurial activity at universities. Furthermore, university scientists, in synergizing between different entrepreneurial roles, are important for venture creation without taking the lead venture entrepreneur role. Involving students in venture creation together with scientists is proposed as one such important entrepreneurial role that has not previously been recognized.","Research paper","Published: 2013, Start page: 453"

Design/methodology/approach – The story of a half‐century evolution is divided into five decades, of SME and entrepreneurship development in France. The development of the French academic system of research on SME and entrepreneurship is described through some teams.
Findings – During the two early decades (1955‐1975), both the social legitimacy and economic competitiveness sharply and deeply lowered, while that after the world crisis (1975) until nowadays (2005), the social, political, and economic interest for SME and entrepreneurship has continuously increased.
Research limitations/implications – The academic research pioneered SME during the 1960s, and entrepreneurship during the 1980s. The historical development of the national network of teams and associations is described, increasingly including the international context.
Practical implications – Beyond the personal testimony, this contribution enlightens the problems entailed by the lack of legitimacy of the spirit of enterprise anchored in French society, and, more generally, in all the societies averse to individual risk taking.
Originality/value – The testimony is based on the personal experience of one scholar who early promoted in the French academic system Master and Doctoral courses on SME and entrepreneurship.

It reports the findings of an exploratory investigation that examines why franchising is selected less frequently as a growth strategy in some industrial sectors than it is in others. The applicability of the main theories used to explain the decision to franchise are tested through a study which focuses on the UK construction industry, a sector containing relatively few franchised operations. It reveals that the high human capital requirement of this industry (as proxied by average wages) may make it unsuitable for franchising. Interviews with franchisors operating in the construction industry indicate that, although few operational difficulties are encountered, the franchisors had experienced severe difficulties in recruiting suitable franchisees, possibly reflecting the high human capital requirement of the sector. It is concluded that further research is needed to compare these findings with those from industry sectors in which the level of franchise representation is high, to determine whether some industries are, in fact, more suited to franchising than others.","Construction industry, Franchising","MCB UP Ltd","Published: 2000, Start page: 295"

In the manufacturing sector in particular, increased requirements for information and knowledge management, innovation, quality, and flexibility within new organisational forms such as the network enterprise entail organisational developments that can affect critical business processes, R&D in particular, and business performance. Hence, the customer dependency of manufacturing SMEs on certain important customers or the absence of diversification in their customer base can have significant impacts on the R&D activities, the productivity, and eventually the profitability of these organisations. Through an empirical study of 179 Canadian SMEs, it was found that more commercially dependent firms allocate more financial and human resources to product R&D. These firms are also less productive in that they have relatively fewer sales per employee. While customer dependency seems to negatively affect the SMEs’ profitability, firms whose product R&D activities are more intense report significantly higher gross margins. R&D activities could allow manufacturing SMEs to counter the influence of their major customers, by reversing the direction of commercial dependency, and thus to reduce their vulnerability.","Research paper","Published: 2004, Start page: 8"

Notable characteristics of such companies now include: a customer‐focused culture; a concentration on core competencies with high levels of outsourcing; an emphasis on team working and manufacturing cells; low levels of stock at all stages of assembly; frequent small deliveries by suppliers directly to the production areas; a supply base of relatively few suppliers; partnership agreements with key first‐tier suppliers. Such companies are aiming to produce goods of world‐class quality and to do so, given the large amounts of bought‐in components and sub‐systems, pay a great deal of attention to the supply network. As a result, the purchasing function in these companies, as the interface with suppliers, plays a crucial role in manufacturing strategy. It is thus important to determine what multinational manufacturing companies want from their suppliers, ie what constitutes the “total package” that they want to have supplied? To this end, a total quality‐based 15‐criteria model of this package was developed and pre‐tested with senior purchasing managers from multinational corporations (MNCs). Based on this model a survey of senior purchasing managers of 170 MNCs throughout Ireland was undertaken and this paper reports on the results from the 62 usable returns.","Supply chain, World‐class manufacturing, TQM","MCB UP Ltd","Published: 2000, Start page: 295"

The research investigates the ways in which entrepreneurs seize opportunities and gain knowledge from the start to the expansion of their ventures.Design/methodology/approachTwo case studies were developed based on a longitudinal fine-grained analysis of two ventures over two years. Entrepreneurs’ success and learning were modeled in line with grounded theory methodology. Data were collected from both primary and secondary sources in the form of semi-structured interviews and archival documentation.FindingsThe authors develop an original conceptual framework that consists of ten entrepreneurial learning opportunities and four knowledge development modes. There are ten generic types of actions that entrepreneurs take. There are then four distinctive ways to transform these experiences into knowledge. The model is assessed in absolute terms and relatively to existing taxonomies.Research limitations/implicationsThe findings question the premises on which entrepreneurial learning research traditionally relies. Opportunities can be open-ended rather than purely instrumental. Similarly, knowledge can be emerging as much as it can be espoused. This opens-up space for further research.Practical implicationsFor practitioners, the findings suggest new ways for making sense of the daily experience of their entrepreneurial endeavor. The learning modes suggested can be used by coaches and mentors when helping entrepreneurs in their venture.Originality/valueThe research provides empirical evidence of what entrepreneurs do. This may help cast traditional debates about what there is to do (logical necessity) and what there is to know (a priori knowledge) in a new light.","Research paper","Published: 2017, Start page: 670"

Claudia Alvarez and David Urbano acknowledge the financial support from the Projects ECO2010‐16760 (Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation) and 2005SGR00858 (Catalan Government Department for Universities, Research and Information Society).","Purpose – The main objective of this paper is to analyse the influence of environmental factors on entrepreneurship at the Spanish regional level, using institutional economics as the theoretical framework for the research. Additionally, this work aims to emphasize how environmental conditions have different effects according to the gender of entrepreneurs.
Design/methodology/approach – Regional panel data (19 Spanish regions and the 2006‐2009 period) from the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM), specifically from the Spanish National Expert Survey (NES) for environmental conditions and the GEM Adult Population Survey (APS) for entrepreneurial activity were analysed within a fixed effects model with panel corrected standard errors.
Findings – The main findings of the study indicate that both informal (cultural and social norms, perception of opportunities to start‐up and entrepreneur social image) and formal factors (intellectual property rights) influence entrepreneurship, but the informal are more determinant than the formal. Concerning the gender issues, informal and formal institutions are also determinant, but female entrepreneurship is significantly associated with the women's support to start‐up, whereas primary and higher education are associated only with male entrepreneurial activity.
Research limitations/implications – The results of the research should be interpreted carefully, because the availability of data constrained the analysis to a time period that is not reflective of the economic cycle; on the contrary, the data correspond to a period of recession, and thus the results cannot be generalized. Also, the study could extend the analysed period and compare the obtained results with international data, considering the global number of participant countries in the GEM Project.
Originality/value – The study provides a methodology to analyse the environmental factors for new firm creation at a regional level, combining GEM data and institutional economics.","Research paper","Published: 2011, Start page: 8"

Much of the specialist consultancy is provided by self‐employed persons under contract for particular projects. This paper focuses on the self‐employed consultants who undertake specialist Business Link‐supported work within SMEs. While most business Links have role and job descriptions for PBAs, this is rarely the case for consultants. Self‐employed consultants are generally accredited by BLs themselves or by third parties. Accreditation procedures could be improved; clear criteria are required for monitoring consultancy processes and outcomes, and consultants need to receive feedback. There are opportunities for closer contact between self‐employed consultants and Business Links which would improve the quality of the service to SMEs, the learning of individuals and the organisational learning and public accountability of Business Links.","Consultants, Small‐ to medium‐sized enterprises, Selection","MCB UP Ltd","Published: 1998, Start page: 7"

Any errors, omissions or opinions expressed in this paper are the sole responsibility of the author.","Research evidence suggests that SMEs are significantly less likely than larger employers to provide or fund formal training leading to qualifications for employees. The training (or more accurately learning) that does take place in most SMEs tends to be informal, on‐the‐job and related to short‐term business objectives or problems. There are strong arguments to suggest that this type of approach is perfectly rational from the point of view of the small business, but may not produce the optimum level or mix of skills for the economy as a whole. Moreover, there is little convincing evidence to suggest that increased investment in formal training leads automatically to improved business performance for SMEs. Research findings raise a number of issues for policy makers and others who are trying to promote the concept of lifelong learning, and associated policy initiatives, to those who own, manage and/or work in SMEs. This paper suggests a number of directions that should be taken by researchers’ policy makers, to promote lifelong learning among SMEs.","Research paper","Published: 2002, Start page: 236"

The overall purpose of the study is to investigate the initial barriers to internationalization experienced and perceived by small retailers based in the UK and the role of government support in addressing such obstacles.
Design/methodology/approach – A qualitative, multiple case research design is adopted. This involves semi‐structured in‐depth interviews with the senior manager/decision‐maker in six retail SMEs based in the UK and the analysis of company documentation and information from a range of secondary sources.
Findings – The findings from the case study data highlight internal and external barriers to internationalization relating to management: lack of vision, fear of losing control, lack of knowledge; the company: transfer of retail concept overseas, lack of resources, lack of consolidation in domestic market; and the external environment: legislation, currency, cultural differences and logistics. The findings also highlight an overall negative experience and perception of government support in assisting smaller retailers to overcome these barriers and aid expansion outside the UK.
Originality/value – The findings of this study provide important insight into the perceived and actual barriers encountered by retail SMEs. On one hand, the focus on SMEs provides fresh evidence to the retail internationalization literature, which has focused primarily on the barriers faced by large multinational retailers. On the other hand, the context of this study, yields new insight into research conducted in the field of SME internationalization, which has to date ignored smaller firms in the retail industry.

To date there has been no systematic study of this group in the UK, and many questions remain unanswered. This study of micro and small business during the initialisation and formation of new venture creation (eg pre‐start‐up, 0‐6 months and 6‐12 months∥ sought to answer some of those questions. It identifies the needs of new business owners, the barriers they encounter, and the strategies they use to overcome those obstacles. The findings indicate that financial difficulties and the attitudes of banks towards new business owners are the main barriers to successful enterprise creation, with mentors and more specific advice cited as the assistance regarded as affording the greatest benefit to potential and new business owners. In addition, small and micro business owners are going out of business, or are unable to fulfil their potential, because they are denied access to those factors that promote success.","Start‐ups, Entrepreneurialism, Barriers","MCB UP Ltd","Published: 2000, Start page: 295"

The findings suggest that franchising is a viable growth strategy for small firms and that per se it creates few major problems for growth‐oriented small businesses.

Design/methodology/approach – The paper employs a field study approach, examining the roles of farmers' specialised cooperatives within the agro‐industrial chain with experiments in Shandong province.
Findings – The paper shows that reforms in the cooperative economy have been gradual, uneven and jerky, favouring the more entrepreneurial or better‐placed farmers to pursue new market opportunities. Creating a sustainable mechanism that would protect and even enhance the interests of the poorer farmers is proving to be far more difficult.
Research limitations/implications – The field study of this paper covers just one region. A further investigation of the impact that the reform dynamics has on the cooperative economy is planned for the near future.
Practical implications – China's approach has favoured experimentation, encouraging initiatives from below and developing a more flexible relationship between government and farmers. This broad bottom‐up approach has allowed for a diversity of models adapted to local conditions, but has also led to uncertainties about the limits of local government influence and the extent of autonomy, with many cooperatives taking an investor‐oriented direction.

Karp Research Award for Best Applied Paper.","Purpose – The purpose of this research is to explore the objectivity and reliability of Entrepreneur Magazine's Franchise 500® ranking system.
Design/methodology/approach – Using data from 1997 to 2004 rankings, regression analysis was used to determine the extent to which key variables explained the rank of franchise firms.
Findings – Several quantifiable measures, categorized by the publishers as “most important” or “important” to a firm's rankings, were found to have little or no explanatory power in the regression model. Longitudinal analysis revealed inconsistencies in the ranking among the top 100 ranked franchises, which question the ranking system's reliability.
Research limitations/implications – Only a subset of the variables used to calculate the rankings are disclosed by the publisher, yet these variables explain a substantial portion of any given franchise's rank. Only the top 100 ranked firms were included in the study.
Practical implications – While considered to be important to a firm's rank, the amount of pending litigation and the percentage of terminations within the system, found to be indicators of conflict between franchisor and franchisees, appear to have little effect on a franchise's rank. Also, size of the franchise system appears to have a strong but inconsistent relationship with rank, both within any given year and over the time period covered by this study. Lastly, the relationship between growth rate and rank, another factor considered by the publisher to be most important, also appears inconsistent, both in terms of number of outlets added and percentage of growth attained over the previous year.
Originality/value – Due to the wide popularity of the ranking system by practitioners and researchers a more systematic examination of the ranking appears justified to understand the underlying research implications of franchising research as it relates to the Franchise 500.","Research paper","Published: 2007, Start page: 8"

In order to deepen and enrich our understanding of these experiences, respondents were asked to reconstruct their insights in narrative form. Following a careful analysis of the transcripts, it was found that three interlocking themes recurred in each of the cases. First, each of the firms had creatively configured their customer relationships in order to secure long‐term resourcing in both financial and knowledge terms. Secondly, they saw innovation as part of their long‐term organisational evolution. Thirdly, they gave priority to human resource development issues, and they viewed this stance as necessary in order to underpin the other two elements.","Small‐ to medium‐sized enterprises, Innovation, Human resource development, Customers, Narratives","MCB UP Ltd","Published: 2000, Start page: 295"

Hannon  (Small Business Centre, Durham University Business School, Mill Hill Lane, Durham)","There is an ongoing debate within the academic literature about the value of the business plan in the development of the small firm. On closer inspection of the research, there appear to be clear benefits in the use of business planning as a process within the smaller business. This is in contrast to the production of a business plan as an output focused predominantly on convincing and acquiring resources from other organisations and individuals. As a process, business planning can be both formal and informal. It is also focused on understanding and responding to the context within which the business operates. Strategic awareness capability, as both a bundle of activities and a core competence, helps to make sense of this context, and serves as a means of managing interactions between the firm and its environment. It also allows for a more sensitive reading of the limitations and strengths of the planning process in markets that are, for the small business, generally unpredicatable and complex. When combined, strategic awareness capability and planning effectiveness can be used to develop a typology of business types that provides insight into the processes by which business development can be supported. In addition, strategic awareness capability can be considered a core competence of the small business and conceptualised in terms of different levels of experience, and expertise. As a result, small firms with varying levels of experience face different challenges and needs when using and developing strategic awareness capability.","Corporate planning, Business plan, Small firms, Strategic evaluation","MCB UP Ltd","Published: 1998, Start page: 102"
